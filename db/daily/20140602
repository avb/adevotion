Heaven Is Not God's Entire Plan

ROMANS 8:29 NIV
29 For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed
to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among
many brothers and sisters.

Just having people go to Heaven is not God's only interest. God
is working to make us like Jesus.

In fact, God has determined that we will be like Jesus, when we
grow up.

EPHESIANS 4:15 NLT
15 Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every
way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the
church.

God is raising a family, causing us to mature and grow up into
being like Jesus Christ.

Too many people think they just need to get "saved" or born
again, and then they can just go on living without giving much
thought to God, while they wait to die and go to Heaven.

No! God desires to be involved with every minute of your life.

The Gospel is not just about going to Heaven. It includes the
privilege of knowing and walking with our Creator every day.

God wants to teach you and train you in many things.

God is your Father and He will not shirk His responsibility to
raise you, train you, and provide for you.

SAY THIS: God has a big plan, which includes a big family. It
is my privilege to be in His family.
