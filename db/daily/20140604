Your Mouth Locates You

LUKE 6:45 WE
45 A good man has stored up good things in his heart, so he
says good things. A bad man has stored up wrong things in his
heart, so he will say wrong things. The mouth will say what is
in the heart.'

What you say locates you.

When you speak freely, you expose (to yourself and others) what
you actually believe.

You may have told others -- or even yourself -- that you are
walking in faith, but what your mouth says locates you and
exposes what is really in your heart.

If you speak words of doubt, you are not strong in faith.

If you speak words of hate and criticism, you are not strong in
love.

You cannot see what is in another person's heart. But if you
listen to their conversation you will know what is in their
heart. Obviously, this only works when they let their guard
down and speak freely.

If someone is putting on an act, they could say anything and
not really mean it. But in times of pressure and crisis, people
usually don't take time to think before speaking, so what they
truly believe comes out.

This message is not meant to condemn you but to wake you up to
reality. If you are speaking anything contrary to what God says
in the Bible, you need to realize you are not in faith in that
area. So you should take steps to remedy the situation by
feeding on God's Word to build up your faith.

SAY THIS: If I ever speak contrary to God's Word, I know it is
time to feed on the Bible and fill my heart with the truth.
