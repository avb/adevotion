You Are Valuable

LUKE 12:6-7 NLT
6 "What is the price of five sparrows -- two copper coins? Yet
God does not forget a single one of them.
7 And the very hairs on your head are all numbered. So don't be
afraid; you are more valuable to God than a whole flock of
sparrows.

Thoughts of inferiority attack us all. No one, no matter how
beautiful or successful, is immune.

How should you determine how valuable you are?

The best way to determine the value of something is to find out
what someone is willing to pay for it. What was the price God
was willing to pay for you?

ROMANS 8:32 NLT
32 Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for
us all, won't he also give us everything else?

The price God was willing to pay for you was the death of His
Son. No greater price could have been paid!

Who should you allow to determine your value? Who is really
smart enough to know you and your potential?

A parent?
A spouse?
A boyfriend or girlfriend?
A neighbor?
A boss or teacher?

Hardly! All these people are limited in their knowledge and
understanding. Compared to God, they are not really that smart!

God thinks you are extremely valuable! Don't let the devil rob
this precious truth from you.

While you are not yet displaying your full potential, God sees
what you will eventually become. God thinks you are valuable
enough to die for!

Although there are billions of other humans, you are not lost
in the crowd. God knows you! He knows the number of hairs on
your head! He knows every desire and dream you have. And even
though He knows everything about you, He still loves you with
an everlasting love!

God is committed to you. He has promised to never leave you or
forsake you.

HEBREWS 13:5 NLT
5 Don't love money; be satisfied with what you have. For God
has said, "I will never fail you. I will never abandon you."

In light of the amazing price God paid for you, there is no
chance He will change His mind about you.

SAY THIS: Almighty God says I am valuable!
