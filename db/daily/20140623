Focus On Eternity

MATTHEW 6:19-20 NLT
19 "Don't store up treasures here on earth, where moths eat
them and rust destroys them, and where thieves break in and
steal.
20 Store your treasures in heaven, where moths and rust cannot
destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal.

When I was young my family had a wall plaque which said:

"Only one life, will soon be past.
Only what's done for Christ will last."

1 CORINTHIANS 3:13 NLT
13 But on the judgment day, fire will reveal what kind of work
each builder has done. The fire will show if a person's work
has any value.

If I buy a vehicle for myself it will last only a few years.
Then it will rust, wear out, and break down.

But if I buy a vehicle for someone that will enable them to
preach the Gospel to more people, the blessing and memory of
that purchase will last for eternity.

This is not to say it is wrong to have nice things for
ourselves. (For it does not bring glory to God for us to be in
lack.) But we should not focus only on ourselves and our needs
alone. If you are selfish and self-centered you will actually
rob yourself of blessing, both now and for eternity.

GALATIANS 6:10 NLT
10 Therefore, whenever we have the opportunity, we should do
good to everyone -- especially to those in the family of faith.

Each day we have a choice: live for eternity, or live for
today.

The wise person will invest time and treasure in what will
last.

SAY THIS: I will focus on things that count for eternity.
