What Is Faith?

ROMANS 1:17 ESV
17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith
for faith, as it is written, "The righteous shall live by
faith."

Since the Bible reveals that we, who have been made righteous
by receiving Jesus Christ, are to live by faith, we need to
know what faith is.

Faith is what you believe. In the New Testament, faith is the
noun form and believe is the verb form of the same word.

Faith is not difficult to understand. If you believe something,
that is your faith. Faith and belief are the same thing.

A belief is something you have accepted as truth and consider
to be true, whether it is actually true or not.

Faith is not a feeling, attitude, outlook, or state. Faith is
primarily a choice, a decision of your will. Nothing can force
you to believe. What you believe is a decision you make.

Here is a definition: Faith is always a decision, based on some
evidence, resulting in some action.

So faith is when you are persuaded by the evidence you have
been presented, and you make the decision to accept it as truth
worthy of action.

If you were told the building you were in was on fire, you
could say all day "I believe the building is on fire." But when
you actually believe it, you will leave the building.

Faith in God is a choice to believe what God says is true. It
is accepting God's Word as evidence worthy of acting upon.

Faith in God and His Word operates on the same principles as
faith in anything else. There are no special rules. It is all a
matter of what you believe.

SAY THIS: Faith is what I believe.
