Jesus Never Fails

1 CORINTHIANS 10:13 NLT
13 The temptations in your life are no different from what
others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the
temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted,
he will show you a way out so that you can endure.

There have been times in my life when it looked like Jesus had
failed me, and I certainly felt like He failed me.

But I was wrong!

Jesus has never failed me.

I have failed Him many times. I deeply regret that.

I also regret the times I doubted the Lord and thought He was
failing me. Jesus does not deserve to be treated that way.

A lot of it happened when I was very immature spiritually. I
guess I expected the Lord to make my life a bed of roses with
never any challenges or difficulties. I thought I could do
whatever I wanted and God would always bless it.

Well, I had to grow up and realize that going my own way and
doing my own thing was not working very well.

Yet, through all of my immaturity, through all of my failures,
through all of my ignorance, Jesus always took care of me. I
always had my needs met. He always helped me and worked things
out for me, eventually. It just didn't always happen at the
time and in the way I thought it would.

Over time I have learned I don't know much. But Jesus does! He
knows everything. He knows the future, and I can trust Him,
because He loves me. And He loves you just as much as He loves
me.

1 CORINTHIANS 1:9 NKJ
9 God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship
of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

SAY THIS: Jesus Christ will never fail me!
