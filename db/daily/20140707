Sin Is Deadly

God loved the people of the world (including you) so much, that
He chose to suffer the penalty justice demands for your sins,
so He could enjoy life with you. We should rejoice in God's
mercy and love, but we should not forget that sin is a terrible
thing.

Sin is not just a list of things God has arbitrarily determined
to be against. Sin is bad. Even if there was no God, sin would
still be bad. God is against sin because it hurts people.

The Bible is clear that sin is deadly. All sin eventually
brings forth death.

I don't mean that sin results in punishment (which is another
issue), but that sin produces death and loss.

ROMANS 5:12 ESV
12 Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because
all sinned -

ROMANS 5:21 ESV
21 so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign
through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus
Christ our Lord.

ROMANS 6:16 ESV
16 Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as
obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey,
either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which
leads to righteousness?

Sin leads to death.

ROMANS 6:23 ESV
23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is
eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Sin pays some very undesirable wages: death.

JAMES 1:15 ESV
15 Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and
sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.

Sin brings forth death, when it is fully grown.

Sin is also deceptive. It can sometimes tantalize by offering
pleasure for a season.

HEBREWS 11:25 ESV
25 choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than
to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.

But when the fleeting pleasure of sin is gone, the pain remains.

SAY THIS: Sin hurts people! Sin is deadly!
