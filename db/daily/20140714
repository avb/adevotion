God Gives You Ability To Get Rich

DEUTERONOMY 8:18 ICB
8 But remember the Lord your God! It is he who gives you the
power to become rich. He keeps the agreement he promised to
your ancestors. So it is today.

I don't want to be critical, but so many preach, using this
verse, that God wants to prosper people for one sole purpose:
to give the money to God so He can afford to proclaim the
Gospel to all the world. But I just don't buy it.

I do believe God desires His people to be givers. And clearly
we should proclaim the Gospel to everyone. Being selfish is the
worst thing you can do. And usually the biggest enjoyment you
can get from something is to give it away to someone who is
thrilled with it.

But surely God is not waiting around till we get enough money
to finance Him. And surely God is not worse than normal earthly
parents. What earthly parent would give their children toys on
Christmas, then tell them the ONLY reason they were given those
gifts is so they could give them away to the neighbor kids?

I already said selfishness is wrong. If you are not a giver,
you are not in God's will. But God does not give you things
only for the purpose of giving them all to someone else.

Deuteronomy 8:18 is simple: it says God is the One making you
rich, and He is doing it because He said He would -- not
because we deserve it!

I especially like:

1 TIMOTHY 6:17 NKJ
17 Command those who are rich in this present age not to be
haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living
God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy.

God is not the kind of being who will make you just barely
scrape by -- He gives us RICHLY all things to ENJOY. God gives
to us because He enjoys it and because He keeps His word!

SAY THIS: I trust in the living God, Who gives me richly all
things to enjoy. He gives me the power to prosper because He
said He would.
