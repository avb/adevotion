The Holy Spirit Is Your Helper

JOHN 15:26 NKJ
26 "But when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from
the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father,
He will testify of Me.

The Holy Spirit's desire and purpose is to help you -- not to
hinder you.

The Holy Spirit is the third Person of the Trinity of God. It
is difficult for humans to understand how there can be only one
God, as the Scriptures teach, yet He can reveal Himself as
three persons. So do not let it be an obstacle for you.

The Holy Spirit is a person, not just a force. He should be
treated with the utmost respect and shown the utmost gratitude.

Following are a few of the ways the Holy Spirit desires to help
you, and will help you if you allow Him to.

In Prayer

ROMANS 8:26 NKJ
26 Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do
not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit
Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot
be uttered.

One weakness of humans, compared to God, is in our limited
knowledge. We do not even know what is happening on the other
side of a wall, let alone the other side of the country. We
also do not know what people are planning to do, but the Holy
Spirit knows everything. And He will help us to pray accurately
and effectively.

One way the Holy Spirit helps us in prayer is by giving us
utterance in a language for prayer which we have never learned.
Thus we can bypass our minds with their doubt and lack of
understanding of what is best, and pray according to the
perfect will of God.

Guides Us

The Holy Spirit will, if allowed, guide you in every area of
life; from the words you should speak, to the spouse you should
marry, to the investments you should make.

JOHN 16:13 NKJ
13 "However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will
guide you . . . .

SAY THIS: Thank You Holy Spirit that You are my Helper!
