Keep Your Word

PROVERBS 11:3 NLT
3 Honesty guides good people; dishonesty destroys treacherous
people.

God keeps His Word (Titus 1:2), and as His children we are to
be like Him (Ephesians 5:1). God is dependable so His people
should be dependable. Christians should be known as people of
honesty.

PROVERBS 12:22 NLT
22 The LORD detests lying lips, but he delights in those who
tell the truth.

Keeping our word should be a priority. Our reputation should be
more important to us than our feelings, our finances, or our
comfort.

We should be like those mentioned in Psalm 15:4 who "keep their
promises even when it hurts." People should be able to depend
on us.

Will we do what we said we would do, even if it costs us? Or
will we only do what benefits us? It is really a question of
whether we will be selfish or whether we will walk in love.

But there is also another important reason to keep our word --
so our faith will work as it should.

MARK 11:23 NKJ
23 "For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain,
'Be removed and be cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in
his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done,
he will have whatever he says.

Jesus taught that for faith to work effectively we must believe
those things we say.

If you don't keep your word, it will affect your faith. If you
want to walk in faith, and thus enjoy all the blessings God has
provided for you, then you must believe what you say. Lying
won't work!

Yet as humans, we all may sometimes find ourselves in
situations beyond our control where it is impossible to keep a
promise we have made. In such cases, we should apologize and go
forward in life, asking God to help us do better next time.

SAY THIS: With God's help, I determine to tell the truth and
keep my word.
