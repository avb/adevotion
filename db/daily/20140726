You Are Righteous In Christ

ROMANS 5:1,9 YLT
1 Having been declared righteous, then, by faith, we have peace
toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
9 much more, then, having been declared righteous now in his
blood, we shall be saved through him from the wrath;

Not much preaching has been done telling believers they are
righteous. But the Bible clearly teaches it. It becomes even
clearer when you realize that often the same word that is
translated "righteous or made righteous" is instead translated
"just or justified."

(The Bible is full of rich truths, but they are not always on
the surface. It can take a little digging and study to realize
the riches available to you.)

"But I thought the Bible said there is no one righteous,"
someone may say.

Yes, it does say that in Romans 3:10, but it is quoting an Old
Testament passage to prove that both Jews and Gentiles were
guilty before God and needed salvation. It immediately goes on
to say in the next few verses (see below) that now we can be
righteous through faith in Jesus Christ.

ROMANS 3:21-22 NKJ
21 But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is
revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,
22 even the righteousness of God which is through faith in
Jesus Christ to all and on all who believe. For there is no
difference;

ROMANS 3:24 YLT
24 being declared righteous freely by His grace through the
redemption that is in Christ Jesus,

SAY THIS: Because of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, I am 
righteous before God.
