The Coming World Ruler

Would you like for me to reveal to you the name of the coming
world ruler?

One of His names is Jesus Christ.

ISAIAH 9:6-7 NKJ
6 For unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is given; And the
government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be
called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father,
Prince of Peace.
7 Of the increase of His government and peace There will be no
end, Upon the throne of David and over His kingdom, To order it
and establish it with judgment and justice From that time
forward, even forever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will
perform this.

If you thought this article would be about the Antichrist, it
reveals that you need to change your focus.

DANIEL 2:44 NKJ
44 "And in the days of these kings the God of heaven will set
up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom
shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and
consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.

REVELATION 19:11-16 NKJ
11 Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He
who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in
righteousness He judges and makes war.
12 His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were
many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except
Himself.
13 He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is
called The Word of God.
14 And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and
clean, followed Him on white horses.
15 Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He
should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a
rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness
and wrath of Almighty God.
16 And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written: KING
OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.

SAY THIS: One day the entire world will be under the dominion
of my King Jesus!
