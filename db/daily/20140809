To See God, Look At Jesus

Do you want to know God? Get acquainted with Jesus through the 
pages of the Bible.

JOHN 12:44-45 NKJ 
44 . . .Jesus. . .said, "He who believes in Me, believes not in 
Me but in Him who sent Me. 
45 "And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me. 

JOHN 14:7-10 NKJ 
7 "If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; 
and from now on you know Him and have seen Him." 
8 Philip said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is 
sufficient for us." 
9 Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long, and yet you 
have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the 
Father; so how can you say, `Show us the Father'? 
10 "Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father 
in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own 
authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works. 

Why am I stressing this point? It's simple. Most people think 
highly of Jesus of Nazareth. After all, there is not anything 
to fault with Him. But when it comes to God, most people blame 
Him for a lot of bad stuff.

The truth is: looking at Jesus gives you a perfectly clear 
picture of what the invisible God is like. Any other picture is 
a lie and a distortion.

SAY THIS: God is like Jesus, and I find no fault in Him.
