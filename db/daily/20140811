God's Word Acts Like A Seed

LUKE 8:11 NKJ
11 "Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

A seed is much smaller than what it produces.

The problem you face may seem huge. In comparison, a scripture
may seem very small. But when planted, that Word will grow in
you and overcome the problem.

A seed always produces after its kind.

Whatever you need, or desire, find scriptures relating to that.
Then plant those scriptures inside you in abundance. Those
seeds will grow up and produce a harvest of what you need or
desire.

A seed is alive: it contains life.

Your physical senses are incapable of judging whether a seed is
alive or not. You cannot see, feel, hear, smell, or taste the
life in a seed. There is only one way to prove a seed is alive
-- plant it.

 A seed does nothing until planted.

Seeds do not grow sitting in a sack on your shelf. They must be
planted in the proper place.

If you desire the Word of God to produce in your life, you must
decide to plant the Word in your heart and mind.

The best way to plant the seed of God's Word in your life is by
speaking the Word. Hearing others speak the Word is good -- but
will not produce as bountiful a harvest as speaking the Word
yourself.

Speaking God's Word with your mouth is essential. As we speak
God's Word we are planting the seed in our heart for the
harvest of results we desire.

ROMANS 10:10 NKJ
10 For with the heart one believes to righteousness, and with
the mouth confession is made to salvation.

Whatever you need to be saved or delivered from, confession
(what you say) is essential.

SAY THIS: God's Word is a seed that will produce blessing in my
life, so I will plant it in my heart and mind by hearing it,
reading it, and speaking it.
