Choose Life Words

DEUTERONOMY 30:19 NLT
19 "Today I have given you the choice between life and death,
between blessings and curses. Now I call on heaven and earth to
witness the choice you make. Oh, that you would choose life, so
that you and your descendants might live!

You have a choice. You can choose life and blessings. Or you
can choose curses and death. You make that choice when you
choose the words you speak.

PROVERBS 18:21 NKJ
21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue, And those who
love it will eat its fruit.

Life and death are in the power of your tongue, so to choose
life -- choose to speak words of life.

JOHN 6:63 NKJ
63 "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing.
The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.

Jesus spoke words of life, and when we speak in agreement with
His Word, we are speaking words of life.

But the world trains us to speak words of death. Our culture
(influenced by the devil) has conditioned us to speak words of
doubt, fear, and death. Here are some examples.

I'm afraid not!
I can't believe it!
I can't believe he did that!
This is about to drive me insane!
This heat is just killing me!
I'm dying to go there!
That thrills me to death!
I laughed till I thought I would die!
I'm so embarrassed I could just die!
That scared the life out of me!
That just blows me away!
That is so sickening!
That just makes me sick!
I'm so sick and tired of that!
Well, I'll be damned!

If you desire life and blessing, then you should not speak
these kinds of words. When you speak you are expressing a
choice. If you desire to choose life and blessing, then you
should speak (only) words of life and blessing.

Jesus defeated the devil for you and stripped him of all
authority. So the devil tries to get you to speak negative
words, and thus give him an opening to bring destruction into
your life. So be aware of the words you speak!

SAY THIS: I choose the kind of life I will have by the words I
choose to speak.
