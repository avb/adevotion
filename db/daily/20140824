Have A Word Harvest

JOSHUA 1:8 NIV
8 Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth;
meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do
everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and
successful.

When God first gave anyone instructions for success, the first
thing He said was to always keep His Word on their lips.

Jesus taught that God's Word was a seed (Luke 8:11). Seed
produces a harvest — if used properly.

The harvest that God's Word produces in your life is freedom
(John 8:31-32). Here are three steps to seeing a harvest of
freedom in your life:

1. Plant the seed of the Word by reading it, saying it, and
hearing it.
2. Water the seed by reading, speaking, and hearing the Word
some more.
3. Gather the harvest by speaking the Word (when you believe it
and know it inwardly).

Most people try to skip the first two steps. No wonder they
have not had better results! You cannot reap the harvest
without planting the seed and watering it.

Feed your faith, in every area you desire to be strong in, by
speaking God's Word that covers those subjects.

Remember — if you want to harvest a continuous crop of freedom
— you must plant the seed of God's Word continuously.

SAY THIS: I will read, speak, and listen to God's Word.
