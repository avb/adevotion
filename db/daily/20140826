The Future Begins Today

PHILIPPIANS 3:13 NKJ
13 ...one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind
and reaching forward to those things which are ahead,

Today IS the first day of the rest of your life. And it will be
what you and God make it.

Your past does not have to dictate your future. You can begin
again. With God you really can have a fresh start.

God can forgive your past -- and help you to forgive yourself.
But most importantly, God can change you. He can make you into
the kind of person you know you should be.

2 CORINTHIANS 5:17 NRSV
17 So if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation:
everything old has passed away; see, everything has become new!

Your life can be different. But don't think it will be
different if you continue to do things exactly the same as you
always have.

For your life to change -- you must MAKE changes.

If you want real change -- God's Word is the key. You must
immerse yourself in the Word. What you feed in determines the
output of your life.

ACTS 20:32 NLT
32 "And now I entrust you to God and the word of his grace -- his
message that is able to build you up and give you an
inheritance with all those he has set apart for himself.

God's Word will build you up. Jesus said it would make you free
-- if you continue in it (John 8:31-32).

The Bible is God's answer to man's problems. It gives life and
hope and instruction so we can walk in victory.

Prayer is also vital. Prayer is communication with God. All
relationships require communication to keep from growing cold.

So, actively involve God in your life. Consult with Him on
every decision. God is the best helper you will ever have.

JOHN 14:16 NKJ
16 "And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another
Helper, that He may abide with you forever,

The future can be better. The choice is yours. If you invite
and involve God in your future -- it will be bright!

SAY THIS: I invite God into every area of my life and future.
