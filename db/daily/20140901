Why I Speak In Tongues

1 CORINTHIANS 14:18 NIV
18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.

Speaking in tongues is speaking in a language you have never
learned. It is a supernatural act possible only by the help of
the indwelling Holy Spirit.

It is estimated that today over 500 million Christians, in
every country on earth, do speak in tongues. It started on the

I think this doctrine has been so controversial because the
devil is against it, knowing how helpful it is to believers.

I have no desire to argue with anyone. I do desire to see
everyone enjoy all the benefits God has freely provided for us.

I speak in tongues because:

* It allows me to communicate with God better. There are things
my mind just cannot put into words which I can express through
the spirit by praying in tongues.

1 CORINTHIANS 14:2 NKJ
2 For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to
God . . . .

* It builds me up spiritually and refreshes me.

1 CORINTHIANS 14:4 NKJ
4 He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself . . . .

There are other benefits. I hope you are enjoying them, too.

SAY THIS: Thank you Lord that I can speak in tongues.
