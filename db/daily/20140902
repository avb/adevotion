The Bible Gives You Instructions For Victory

JOSHUA 1:8 NLT
8 Study this Book of Instruction continually. Meditate on it
day and night so you will be sure to obey everything written in
it. Only then will you prosper and succeed in all you do.

God has the answer for every problem. God's Word is God's
wisdom (Luke 11:49).

The Bible is God's message, given to you from His heart of
love, so you can know the truth, and have a sure foundation on
which to base your life.

The Bible was not given to put you down, but to raise you up.
Not to put you in bondage, but to make you free! (John 8:31-32)

God's Word gives you dependable truth you can use to form your
beliefs, so that your beliefs will line up with the reality of
how God's creation works. God alone knows all truth, and in the
Bible He shared what you need to know to live a blessed life.

Follow God's instructions and things will go well with you. The
answer for success in life is to do what the Bible says to do,
because it is truth.

SAY THIS: The Bible is my instruction book for victory.
