I Am Wrong

"What are you wrong about, preacher?"

I don't know. If I knew I would change.

"Then how do you know you're wrong?"

Unless I'm perfect and know everything -- I must be wrong about
some things. I just don't know what.

"But I thought preachers knew everything."

Some of them may think they do. But even the Apostle Paul, who
wrote most of the New Testament, said he only knew in part.

1 CORINTHIANS 13:12 NIV
12 Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we
shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know
fully, even as I am fully known.

There are two ways to face life: thinking you know everything
and are doing everything right, or realizing you are not yet
perfect. The first way is pride, the second is humility.

If you think you know everything, you cut yourself off from
learning. If you think everything you do is right, you almost
eliminate any chance of improvement.

Do you really desire to never know more than you do now? Would
it please you to never make any progress from where you are
now?

Then, to protect you from the enemy of pride, start each day
saying, "I am wrong. Lord, show me where to change."

Pride stunts your growth as a person. Pride retards progress.
Pride robs you — and can kill. Pride causes strife and destroys
relationships. Pride isolates. Pride closes doors of
opportunity.

Humility is the only antidote for pride and all its horrible
consequences.

The first step to wholeness is to realize you have a problem.

SAY THIS: I am wrong. Lord, please correct me.
