Another Helper

Who among us could not use another helper?

JOHN 14:16-18 NKJ
16 "And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another
Helper, that He may abide with you forever,
17 "even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive,
because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him,
for He dwells with you and will be in you.
18 "I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you.

JOHN 14:26 NKJ
26 "But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send
in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your
remembrance all things that I said to you.

JOHN 16:7 NKJ
7 "Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage
that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not
come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.

JOHN 16:13 NKJ
13 "However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will
guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own
authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will
tell you things to come.

ROMANS 8:26 NKJ
26 Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do
not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit
Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot
be uttered.

SAY THIS: Thank you Lord for sending your Holy Spirit to be my
Helper.
