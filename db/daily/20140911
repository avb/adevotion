Pay Your Teachers

GALATIANS 6:6-7 NLT
6 Those who are taught the word of God should help their
teachers by paying them.
7 Don't be misled. Remember that you can't ignore God and get
away with it. You will always reap what you sow!

A law of human behavior is that you will get more of what you
reward, or support. If those who teach the Bible are not
supported, less people will teach the Bible. This is not the
will of God!

If we expect to keep learning, we must support teachers.
Otherwise, without support, there will be no teachers. Then who
will be left to teach us? Basketball players? Movie stars?

1 CORINTHIANS 9:11-14 NLT
11 We have planted good spiritual seed among you. Is it too
much to ask, in return, for mere food and clothing?
12 If you support others who preach to you, shouldn't we have
an even greater right to be supported? Yet we have never used
this right. We would rather put up with anything than put an
obstacle in the way of the Good News about Christ.
13 Don't you know that those who work in the Temple get their
meals from the food brought to the Temple as offerings? And
those who serve at the altar get a share of the sacrificial
offerings.
14 In the same way, the Lord gave orders that those who preach
the Good News should be supported by those who benefit from it.

God's plan is for us to support those who teach His Word. This
will insure an ample supply of people ready to continue
teaching you, and others, the things of God. How valuable is
that to you?

(God is not pleased when we do not value His Word highly. It is
disrespectful to God, and not very smart.)

SAY THIS: I will honor God and His Word by supporting those who
preach and teach the Bible.
