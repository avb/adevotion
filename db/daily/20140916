God Will Provide

GENESIS 22:14a NLT
14 Abraham named the place Yahweh-Yireh (which means "the LORD
will provide").

One of God's names is Yahweh-Yireh (also spelled Jehovah Jireh)
which means, "the Lord will see to it," that is, "the Lord will
provide." The Lord sees ahead and provides. That is one of His
names! God cares for you, and plans for your provision, even
before you know you need it.

There will not be one day in your entire life that God has not
seen ahead and made provision for you. It may require some
searching for you to find it. It may even be difficult to
obtain. But God's provision is always there!

MATTHEW 6:26 CEB
26 Look at the birds in the sky. They don't sow seed or harvest
grain or gather crops into barns. Yet your heavenly Father
feeds them. Aren't you worth much more than they are?

Jesus said God provides food for the birds, implying that God
provides for every creature. Yet, if a bird sits still, instead
of gathering the food God has provided for them, they can
starve. God does not carry food to their nest and put it in
their mouths.

Birds don't sit in the spot where they found food yesterday and
wait for food to show up there today. They keep looking,
obviously confident that food is available somewhere.

If you accept lack, you may have it. But if you have as much
faith as a bird you will keep looking for your provision until
you find it, because you know that God has made provision for
you.

You may have to look in a different place than you found your
provision yesterday, and you may have to look longer than you
did yesterday, but if you keep looking you will find it.

SAY THIS: I can trust God to always provide what I need.
