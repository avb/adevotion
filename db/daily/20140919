Does God Supply Only What We Need?

What is a need? Who is qualified to determine what is a need?

Is it something essential? What is essential? Essential to
what? To survival? To health? (Physical health only, or mental
and emotional health, as well?)

Are essentials universal? Or do they vary from person to
person, or from country to country, or from age to age?

Is having more than just my essential, survival needs met proof
of my greed or selfishness?

If God will only meet our needs, why do some Christians have
more than they need? How did they get it? Did the devil give it
to them?

If God only meets the needs of Christians, who will ever have
any extra to give to others?

What is need and what is greed; what is too much and what is
just right? Are you qualified to judge? For yourself? For me?
For someone in a different country? For all people?

Is it wrong for a Christian to accept a job paying more than a
survival wage? Should they only work part-time to stay below
abundance?

Does God play favorites? Did the Apostle Paul say, in
Philippians 4:18, that he had more than he needed? Did God ever
give anyone else an abundance?

Does creation testify to a God of abundance? Why are there so
many shapes and colors of fish? Why do we need flowers?

Can you give scripture clearly saying God will supply only what
we need to barely get by? Are there not many scriptures that
tell us He supplies abundance? Have you ever read the entire
Bible?

What is a need? Are you qualified to judge?

SAY THIS: Has my view of God's provision been correct?
