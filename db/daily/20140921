God Is Not A Liar

NUMBERS 23:19 ICB
19 God is not a man. He will not lie. God is not a human being.
He does not change his mind. What he says he will do, he does.
What he promises, he keeps.

Too many of us judge God by ourselves, or those we normally
deal with. Unfortunately, honesty is scarce today. We are
accustomed to people lying to us.

But God is different. He does not lie. Not ever.

TITUS 1:2 NKJ
2 in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised
before time began,

SAY THIS: My God is not a liar. He will do what He said He
would do.
