On Earth As It Is In Heaven

MATTHEW 6:10 KJV
10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in
heaven.

People often wonder what God's will is in many situations. "How
should we pray? Is it God's will for this person to be helped,
or not?"

In Matthew 6:10 Jesus told us how to pray in line with God's
will -- what is done in heaven is also God's will for earth.

This verse reveals the will of God and answers how we are to
pray. So anything opposing this cannot ever be God's will.

What should we learn from this verse?

First, the will of God is not automatically done, otherwise
there would be no need to instruct us to pray for God's will to
be done on earth.

Second, if God's will is not automatically being done, it means
the will of our enemy (the devil) may be done unless God's
people do what we are supposed to do.

Third, the will of God is always good for all people, for it is
certainly good for everyone who is in heaven. (See also James
1:17, Psalm 145:9, Matthew 5:44-45)

Many have made the mistake of thinking everything that happens
must be God's will. No! We must pray that God's will be done on
earth. It is not automatic. Every theft, rape, and murder is
not God's will!

When it is not like heaven on earth, it is because the reign of
God's kingdom is not being fully manifest in that situation.
The reign, or kingdom of God, is where King Jesus has dominion.

As we allow Jesus complete dominion in our lives, we can expect
the blessing and provision of God to begin manifesting on earth
as it does in heaven.

SAY THIS: As it is in heaven, so it is God's will for it to be
on earth.
