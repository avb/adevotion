Don't Judge By Appearance

JOHN 7:24 NKJ
24 "Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with
righteous judgment."

Making a snap judgment based on appearance often works -- but
not always. And the exceptions can really cost you.

The world teaches us to judge people by their appearance. But
God doesn't judge people by how they look -- and neither should
we.

1 SAMUEL 16:7 NLT
7 But the LORD said to Samuel, "Don't judge by his appearance
or height, for I have rejected him. The LORD doesn't make
decisions the way you do! People judge by outward appearance,
but the LORD looks at a person's thoughts and intentions."

One main reason we're not qualified to judge others is because
we don't know their thoughts and intentions. Only God does.

As they say, "You can't always judge a book by its cover."

LUKE 16:15 CEV
15 But Jesus told them: You are always making yourselves look
good, but God sees what is in your heart. The things that most
people think are important are worthless as far as God is
concerned.

It is important that we treat all people with respect -- since
they are created and loved by God -- no matter how they look.

SAY THIS: Lord, help me to not judge people by their
appearance.
