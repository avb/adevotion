Trust In God

2 CHRONICLES 16:7-9 NLT
7 At that time Hanani the seer came to King Asa and told him,
"Because you have put your trust in the king of Aram instead of
in the LORD your God, you missed your chance to destroy the
army of the king of Aram.
8 Don't you remember what happened to the Ethiopians and
Libyans and their vast army, with all of their chariots and
horsemen? At that time you relied on the LORD, and he handed
them all over to you.
9 The eyes of the LORD search the whole earth in order to
strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. What
a fool you have been! From now on, you will be at war."

When you look to other sources for help -- instead of turning
to God when you face trouble, it displeases God.

How would you feel if your spouse completely ignored you and
went to someone else when they had a problem, instead of
turning to you for advice or help?

Looking to others instead of God for help can also open the
door for trouble in your life. That is why God wants you to
look to Him, instead of other sources, because unlike others,
He will never harm you or mislead you.

God is not only able to help you, but He is very willing to
help you with everything, for He loves you! Therefore you can
trust God to always be willing to help you.

So why would you want to look to an inferior source for help?

Fortunately, God is forgiving, so even if you have looked to
others for help instead of God, just turn to God whole-
heartedly and He will surely help you.

God can, and often does, provide help, encouragement, and
advice through other Christians. But we should never look to
them first as our source of help.

Always look to God first and keep your focus on Him.

SAY THIS: I will trust in Almighty God, who loves me, and
always look to Him as my source of help.
