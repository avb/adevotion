Is Money Your God?

Whatever controls you, or determines your decisions, is your
god.

What is god in your life? Do you have a price? Can you be
bought?

Will enough money get you to do something you know is wrong?
Then you are serving money -- you will do what it tells you.

No one can serve two masters, according to Jesus.

MATTHEW 6:24 NKJ
24 "No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the
one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and
despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.

You must choose who your god will be. If you choose Jesus
Christ -- you cannot make every decision based on the financial
bottom line, and still claim He is your Lord.

If you claim to be a Christian but do not worship God by giving
from your income to Him -- it is clear that money is your god.

If you say you do not give to God so that you can feed your
children -- maybe your children are your god.

If your reason for not worshiping God with your money is so you
can pay your house or car note -- you obviously have put them
ahead of God.

Most Christians think it's awful that someone would commit
adultery, or fornication, if someone paid them. But, a
Christian who moves simply to get a higher-paying job, without
regard to God's guidance, is guilty of the same sin: serving
money.

Will you only do God's will if it benefits you? Are you like a
prostitute -- only willing to perform if you get paid enough?

Are you a hired lover -- or a genuine lover of God? This is a 
very serious question we all need to consider. The good news is 
that God still loves us -- no matter how undeserving we are of 
His love. But understanding God's love should cause us to 
desire change. God does not deserve to be treated the way most 
of us have been treating Him.

SAY THIS: I will serve God. I refuse to serve money. Instead,
money will serve me.
