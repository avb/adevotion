Harvest Is Coming

GALATIANS 6:9 NLT
9 So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the
right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give
up.

When a farmer has planted seed in the ground, it does not
produce a harvest the next day. There is a period of waiting. A
time to stand in faith, knowing that the seed will grow and
produce as it was created to do.

It takes faith for a farmer to bury expensive seed in the
ground. But the farmer knows how God's system works. (Even if
the farmer does not believe in God, it is still God's system he
is using.) You plant the seed, you wait, and then comes a
harvest that multiplies what you planted.

2 CORINTHIANS 9:10-11 NLT
10 For God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then
bread to eat. In the same way, he will provide and increase
your resources and then produce a great harvest of generosity
in you.
11 Yes, you will be enriched in every way so that you can
always be generous. And when we take your gifts to those who
need them, they will thank God.

Harvest is coming in your life! All the seeds of love you have
sown into the lives of others, and into the Kingdom of God,
have been growing and the time for a harvest of blessing is
coming.

Harvest is also coming to the Body of Christ on the earth.
Multitudes of people will turn to Jesus Christ as their Lord
and Savior. We must be ready to welcome them and have the
resources ready to assist them and disciple them.

So believe for a harvest of blessing and prosperity in your
life. Then you will be ready to be a blessing to others.

SAY THIS: I believe harvest is coming.
