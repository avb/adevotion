Divorce

MALACHI 2:16 NIV
16 "I hate divorce," says the LORD God of Israel, "and I hate a
man's covering himself with violence as well as with his
garment," says the LORD Almighty. So guard yourself in your
spirit, and do not break faith.

God hates divorce because He loves people. Keep that in focus.
Divorce hurts people, so God is against it. But God is NOT
against the person who is divorced.

Many reading this have been divorced, and would agree that
divorce is no fun for anyone. It is devastating, ranking right
up with the death of a spouse or a child in causing stress.

Divorce does not usually solve problems, but creates more
problems. Whatever is causing conflict and trouble will almost
surely still be there after a divorce.

If you are thinking about getting a divorce -- don't.

(Of course, if your life is in danger, you should protect 
yourself.)

With God's love and faith, anything can be faced and overcome.
God, who raises the dead, can also resurrect your marriage and
give you love for each other.

If you have been divorced, God is not mad at you. He still
loves you. (Remember, the reason God is against divorce is that
He loves you and wants to spare you the pain and suffering.)

Divorce is NOT the unforgivable sin. And remember, when God
forgives He forgets. While it is true that you may continue to
suffer effects of a divorce in this natural realm, as far as
God is concerned, it can be forgiven and forgotten.

SAY THIS: God hates divorce because He loves people, including
me.
