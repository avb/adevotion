Sprinkle The Blood

1 PETER 1:2 NKJ
2 . . . in sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience and
sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace
be multiplied.

By faith we can sprinkle the Blood of Jesus on people who come
to us for help. The Blood is a token of Christ's total
redemption, signaling the devil that he must flee. By faith in
that precious Blood all can be delivered.

Blood in the human body brings healing to sick tissue. The
Blood of Jesus brings healing to His body as well.

LEVITICUS 17:11 NKJ
11 `For the life of the flesh is in the blood . . .

Blood delivers everything necessary for the members of a human
body and carries away waste material. Jesus' Blood also brings
life and nourishment to the members of His body, and rids us of
everything that is of the curse.

When the Israelites in Egypt had blood on their door, no evil
dared enter their dwelling. Likewise, we are kept safe through
the protection of the divine Blood of Jesus.

Jesus' Blood overcomes the devil and all he has done. Believe
it in your heart and say it with your mouth -- until you see
complete victory.

2 CORINTHIANS 10:4 NKJ
4 For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in
God for pulling down strongholds,

By faith, sprinkle the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ anywhere
there is evidence of satanic effort to stop the complete will
of God in your life.

Let us use all our weapons: the Name of Jesus, the Word of God,
and the Blood of the Lamb.

SAY THIS: By faith I apply the Blood of Jesus to my life and
property.
