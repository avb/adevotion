Pray Through Daily

Many have criticized the old phrase "praying through," by
rightfully telling us that now there is no need to struggle in
prayer, since Jesus has already won the battle for us.

The devil is defeated, and any child of God has the right to
use the Name of Jesus and immediately be through the devil's
resistance and be heard by our Father God.

However, in life we must deal with things of the flesh and this
world, which can pry our focus off God.

Spiritually, we can grow dull. It can seem like we are in a
fog. Things are not clear. We do not have a note of victory and
triumph. We can, and must, press through these impediments.

Pray through -- until praying is not hard. Pray until you enjoy
it, because you have broken through the things of your flesh
and this world that would hold you back from enjoying daily
fellowship with your Father God.

MATTHEW 26:41 NASB
41 "Keep watching and praying, that you may not enter into
temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."

SAY THIS: I will "pray through" every day.
