The Blood Speaks

HEBREWS 12:24 NKJ
24 to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood
of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel.

The Blood testifies that Jesus set us free from all the curse 
and made us able to partake of the inheritance of the saints. 
The Blood testifies that Jesus bought our redemption and set us 
free from the devil.

EPHESIANS 1:7 NIV
7 In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness
of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace

God worked when the blood of Abel cried unto Him -- how much
more mightily He will work when it is the blood of His own Son
that cries.

By speaking words of faith, we agree with what the Blood says
concerning our total and absolute redemption and freedom from
the curse.

ROMANS 5:9 NIV
9 Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more
shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!

HEBREWS 9:12 KJV
12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own
blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained
eternal redemption for us.

SAY THIS: Jesus' Blood declares that I am free and forgiven.
