Think You Know Something?

1 CORINTHIANS 8:2 NIV
2 The man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he
ought to know.

1 CORINTHIANS 8:2 LB
2 If anyone thinks he knows all the answers, he is just showing
his ignorance.

A problem we have is that we don't know what we don't know.

(Certainly, we can trust in God's Word (the Bible) and know it
is truth -- as long as we are accurately reading it.)

Just like you, I evaluate things based on what I think I know.
I evaluate myself. I evaluate others.

But are my evaluations correct? Do I know as much as I think I
do? Am I using the right criteria? Do I really see the whole
picture as God does? Am I really qualified?

What should we do? We have to make choices everyday -- which
implies making judgments in the sense of making evaluations. We
have to proceed based on the best information we have at the
time.

But just remember, not one of us knows everything. So walk
humbly before God and mankind. Those you think are wrong today,
you may realize tomorrow are actually right.

If we are wise, we will live in the constant realization that
we need God's wisdom and guidance in all we do. God is not too
busy for you to talk with Him about every decision you face --
no matter how small it is.

SAY THIS: God is the One Who knows all things -- not me.
