How Does God Bless Us?

Does God bless us by giving us everything we think we should
have, even if it's bad for us?

Does God bless us by always letting us have our way -- whether
it's the best way for us, or not?

Does God bless us by letting us get away with self-destructive
behavior?

Does God bless us by letting us mistreat other people with
impunity?

Does God bless us by giving us more responsibility, more money,
or more fame, than we can handle?

Does God bless us by allowing us to never face the consequences
of our actions?

Does God bless us by never allowing us to struggle or overcome
difficulty?

If God blessed us in any of those ways, He would not be a good
Father.

God blesses us by changing us into what we should be. He makes
us to BE a blessing. That puts us into God's category, where we
can enjoy fellowship with Him -- which is the greatest blessing.

GENESIS 12:2 NIV
2 "I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you; I
will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.

SAY THIS: Thank you Lord for your blessing.
