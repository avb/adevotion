3 Keys To A Happy Marriage

(Or, any relationship.)

JOHN 13:17 KJV
17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.

1. Be thankful.

It all starts with attitude. If you don't stay on the positive
side, failure is inevitable. You cannot have a happy marriage
without happy people. Have you noticed that unthankful people
are never happy?

2. Express your appreciation.

Let your spouse know by word and deed that you appreciate them.
Be specific and lavish in your praise and thanks. Nothing
encourages people like encouragement.

People love people who love them. If you want your spouse to
love you, the best thing you can do is love them, and let them
know it.

3. Aim to please.

If you make them happy, you will be happy. True happiness is
never found in trying to please ourselves. Fulfillment comes
from accomplishment, and the greatest accomplishment is helping
someone else in their life.

SAY THIS: With God's help, I will have a happy marriage.
