God's Way Is Best

PSALM 18:30 NKJ
30 As for God, His way is perfect; The word of the LORD is
proven; He is a shield to all who trust in Him.

Life's biggest temptation may be to doubt God. But God's way is
perfect.

DEUTERONOMY 32:4 NKJ
4 He is the Rock, His work is perfect; For all His ways are
justice, A God of truth and without injustice; Righteous and
upright is He.

God simply knows more than we do. Just because something seems
to us like it would be good, does not guarantee we are right.

God has much more experience than we do. We need to trust in
His love, heed His warnings, and follow His instruction given
to us in the Bible -- not just to please Him, but for our own
happiness as well.

DEUTERONOMY 30:19 NKJ
19 "I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you,
that I have set before you life and death, blessing and
cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your
descendants may live;

Because of the curse resulting from mankind's rebellion against
God, death in all its forms operates on earth. But we can
escape that curse by choosing God's way, which is a way of
blessing and fullness of life.

God's way is exactly what you would choose if you knew as much
as God knows. If you had all the information available to you
that God does, you would make the same choices.

God operates out of love for us, never out of selfish motives.

God's instructions are not to deprive us, but to protect us and
bless us. God knows and understands how things work, and He
wants to share the truth with us -- for our good.

SAY THIS: I trust my Heavenly Father and know His way is always
best for me.
