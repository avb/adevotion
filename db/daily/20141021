Jesus Took A Nap

LUKE 8:23 NLT
23 On the way across, Jesus lay down for a nap, and while he
was sleeping the wind began to rise. A fierce storm developed
that threatened to swamp them, and they were in real danger.

So many people are driven -- feeling and acting like the
responsibility for running the whole world is on their
shoulders.

But Jesus was able to relax. Arguably, He had an important job
to do. Yet He had balance in His life. He knew when it was time
to take a nap.

Jesus also spent whole nights in prayer. So, His example does
not encourage laziness or apathy. Just balance -- and trust in
God, instead of worry.

Some may think it would be a sin to "take a nap" because we
should always be working. But Jesus never sinned, and we may
safely follow His example, and keep our lives in balance.

SAY THIS: I will relax and trust God.
