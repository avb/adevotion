Jesus Is The Good Shepherd

JOHN 10:11-13 NKJ
11 "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life
for the sheep.
12 "But a hireling, he who is not the shepherd, one who does
not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep
and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep and scatters them.
13 "The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not
care about the sheep.

Jesus is no hireling who might desert His sheep. If you belong
to Jesus, you need never fear being without help and provision.

Jesus promised He will NEVER leave us or forsake us (Hebrews
13:5). No matter what we face in this life (or afterward),
Jesus will be there with us to help us.

How can we judge whether a shepherd is good, or not?

We can only evaluate how good a shepherd is by the condition of
his flock. If the flock is not in top shape, or they lack
anything, it is evident the shepherd is not doing a good job.

Jesus is not just "a good shepherd." He is "THE" good shepherd.
He is the very definition of what a good shepherd is. No one is
better!

You may look around, even at your own life, and think that many
of Jesus' sheep are in bad shape.

Yet we must understand that if we run away from Jesus and
refuse to allow Him to shepherd us, it is not His fault if we
are in bad shape.

When we run off and do our own thing, we should not blame Jesus
if the outcome is not good.

If we do ever find ourselves in poor shape, we should question
whether we are really allowing Jesus to be our Shepherd, or
whether we have ignored Jesus and chose to go our own way.

So any time we find ourselves facing any trouble or need, our
first reaction should be to run to our Shepherd. He is always
ready, willing, and able to help us -- even to the point of
giving up His life for our benefit! That is how good and
dedicated our wonderful Shepherd is!

SAY THIS: I am privileged to have the best shepherd in the
universe taking care of me: my Lord Jesus Christ!
