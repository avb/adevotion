Cursed By Blessings?

PROVERBS 10:22 KJV
22 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no
sorrow with it.

What we might consider "blessings" don't always help people.
Sometimes they hurt.

We don't always know what is best for us. Often, what we think
we want turns out to be a big mistake.

Consider the case of two girls: one extremely beautiful -- the
other quite plain looking. Because of her natural beauty, the
one becomes totally self-absorbed. Thinking herself superior,
she grows haughty and proud, and, although rich and famous, has
no true friends.

She selfishly only seeks her own welfare and gives no thought
to other's desires or happiness.

As she grows older and less attractive, she cannot live with
not being the center of attention. Lonely and depressed, she
finally takes her life.

The other girl, not being endowed with any great natural
beauty, is not tempted to be proud and haughty. She is forced
to develop in other ways.

She, being humble, is willing and ready to help others and
gains many friends. Because she could not rely on her natural
abilities in life, she was forced to turn to God and seek His
help. With God's life and love manifesting through her, she was
able to marry a godly man, and they raised a fine family
together and enjoyed a long and happy life.

Which girl was really blessed?

Just remember: what you think you want is not always what you
would really want. Be thankful for what you have and who you
are.

SAY THIS: Thank you Lord for my life.
