Be A Giver

God is a giver and desires His children to be givers. Giving is
the opposite of selfishness. Giving is love in action. And God
blesses those who give.

LUKE 6:38 NIV
38 Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed
down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into
your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to
you."

PROVERBS 3:9-10 NKJ
9 Honor the Lord with your possessions, and with the
firstfruits of all your increase;
10 So your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will
overflow with new wine.

MATTHEW 10:42 NIV
42 And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these
little ones because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he
will certainly not lose his reward."

2 CORINTHIANS 9:6-8 NIV
6 Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap
sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap
generously.
7 Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to
give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a
cheerful giver.
8 And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in
all things at all times, having all that you need, you will
abound in every good work.

HEBREWS 6:10 NIV
10 God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love
you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue
to help them.

LUKE 12:33 NIV
33 Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses
for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven
that will not be exhausted, where no thief comes near and no
moth destroys.

ACTS 20:35 NIV
35 In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard
work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord
Jesus himself said: `It is more blessed to give than to
receive.'"

God designed His system with incentives to encourage people to
give. He has promised to bless those who give, both now and in
the age to come.

SAY THIS: I will be a giver, like my Father in Heaven.
