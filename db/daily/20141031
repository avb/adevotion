You Reap What You Sow

GALATIANS 6:7 NKJ
7 Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man
sows, that he will also reap.

The Bible says it, so you can count on it.

EPHESIANS 6:8 NKJ
8 knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the
same from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free.

LUKE 6:38 NKJ
38 "Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed
down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your
bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it will be
measured back to you."

The world has a saying for this, "Whatever goes around, comes
around."

If you are unkind, you can expect unkindness to come toward
you.

If you are merciful, you can expect others to be merciful to
you.

If you are generous, others will be generous with you.

You cannot expect to plant carrot seeds and harvest tomatoes.
It does not work in the physical realm, neither does it
work in the spiritual realm. You will reap what you plant, and
only what you plant.

2 CORINTHIANS 9:6 NKJ
6 But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap
sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap
bountifully.

PROVERBS 11:24-25 NKJ
24 There is one who scatters, yet increases more; And there is
one who withholds more than is right, But it leads to poverty.
25 The generous soul will be made rich, And he who waters will
also be watered himself.

Whatever you need, or whatever you desire in your life -- give
that to someone else.

If you desire friendship, be friendly to others. If you desire
forgiveness, forgive others. If you desire to be loved, show
love to others. If you desire money, give some money away.

MATTHEW 7:12 NKJ
12 "Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to
them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.

SAY THIS: I will reap what I sow.
