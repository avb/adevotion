Ministers Should Teach The Truth About Money

2 TIMOTHY 2:15b NLT
15 Be a good worker, one who does not need to be ashamed and
who correctly explains the word of truth.

Teaching about money is not easy.

Preachers know that people do not like to be told what to do
with their money -- especially if it involves giving it away.

No preacher wants people to think he has selfish motives, so
preachers often shy away from preaching much on money. They
know people might suspect they are preaching about money only
in order to raise funds.

You must also first know the truth about money in order to
preach it. Unfortunately, our level of knowledge on this
subject in the church has been very low.

We are all learning and God is endeavoring to teach us and give
us a balanced understanding. (But God's balance may seem
extreme to many people!) You may also be surprised -- as I have
been -- to find out that some things you have been taught were
not right.

The truth is that God gave us revelation in His Word that must
be understood and obeyed if we are to walk in the fullness of
blessing Jesus Christ paid for us to have. We need to hear
preaching on these truths. So we need preachers with the
courage to preach truth, with no fear of people.

I realize -- for your sake -- I should be more bold to preach
more on what the Bible says about money and prosperity.

Yet we don't want to go to the other extreme and preach only
about money, as if money is the only thing that matters. For
that is certainly not what Jesus taught!

We must present truth to people as accurately and fully as we
can, regardless of whether it is popular or not. For only the
truth will make people free. And we must never forget that none
of us knows it all yet. So we should stay open to further
instruction the Lord may send our way.

SAY THIS: Lord, please help me to understand and to teach the
truth about money.
