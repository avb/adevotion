Some Truths About Money

* Money is not true riches.

LUKE 16:11 ESV
11 If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous
wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?

Money cannot buy lasting happiness and fulfillment. If money
guaranteed happiness all rich people would be happy -- but
they're not. Money will never love you back. Money is only a
tool to use on earth.

LUKE 12:15 ESV
15 And he said to them, "Take care, and be on your guard
against all covetousness, for one's life does not consist in
the abundance of his possessions."

* You cannot serve money and God.

LUKE 16:13 NLT
13 "No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and
love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the
other. You cannot serve both God and money."

You can serve God and have money. But you cannot serve two
masters at the same time. Only one can ultimately control you.

* Loving money leads to evil.

1 TIMOTHY 6:10 NKJ
10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for
which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and
pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

* Where your money is, there your heart will be also (Luke 12:34).

So if you want to know where your heart is, just look at what
you do with your money.

* God is not against His people being rich. But God is against
us being covetous, proud, and selfish.

1 TIMOTHY 6:17 ESV
17 As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be
haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches,
but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.

2 CORINTHIANS 9:11 GWN
11 God will make you rich enough so that you can always be
generous. Your generosity will produce thanksgiving to God
because of us.

SAY THIS: Thank You Lord for teaching me truth about money.
