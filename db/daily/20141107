Sing A New Song

PSALM 96:1 NIV
1 Sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth.

No doubt God, who makes every snowflake different, enjoys new
things.

Five times Scripture tells us to sing to the Lord a new song.

You, with God's help, can sing a song to the Lord that's never
been sung before.

Don't say you can't do it! God made your mouth and He can give
you words to sing.

God is a Creator, and you are His child. Step out in faith. Ask
the Lord to help you.

PSALM 105:2 NASB
2 Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; speak of all His wonders.

Get by yourself and practice. Sing a new song. Make it up as
you go. If you mess up, God won't laugh at you. It may not be
very good. But every parent cherishes their child's first
attempts.

Make a joyful noise. Rejoice in the Lord. Both you and the Lord
will enjoy it.

EPHESIANS 5:19 NIV
19 . . . Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord,

After you practice in private, you may even want to try it in
public.

SAY THIS: I will sing a new song to the Lord.
