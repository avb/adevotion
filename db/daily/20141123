God Is A Genius

ROMANS 11:33 KJV
33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge
of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past
finding out!

ROMANS 11:33 NLT
33 Oh, what a wonderful God we have! How great are his riches
and wisdom and knowledge! How impossible it is for us to
understand his decisions and his methods!

AMOS 4:13 LB
13 For you are dealing with the One who formed the mountains,
made the winds, and knows your every thought; he turns the
morning to darkness and crushes down the mountains underneath
his feet: Jehovah, the Lord, the Lord Almighty, is his name."

JEREMIAH 10:12 LB
12 But our God formed the earth by his power and wisdom, and by
his intelligence he hung the stars in space and stretched out
the heavens.

ISAIAH 28:29 NIV
29 All this also comes from the LORD Almighty, wonderful in
counsel and magnificent in wisdom.

PSALM 147:5 NIV
5 Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has
no limit.

PSALM 104:24 LB
24 O Lord, what a variety you have made! And in wisdom you have
made them all! The earth is full of your riches.

Just because you can't figure out any way out of a situation,
does not mean God cannot.

God has all knowledge, wisdom, and understanding.

He has the ability to create everything you see, and everything
you can't even see, just by speaking a word.

If we were able to measure God's intelligence, we would find
that it is perfect and complete. There is nothing God does not
know.

SAY THIS: God is smarter than anyone knows. God is a genius.
