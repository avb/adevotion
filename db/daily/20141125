The Weapon of the Spirit

EPHESIANS 6:17 NKJ
17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the
Spirit, which is the word of God;

A soldier needs a weapon. In Bible days a sword was the most
effective weapon available. Today we have machine guns and
other sophisticated weapons.

But there is no weapon more powerful than the one God has
provided for His children: the Word of God.

To help you grasp this better it may help to remember that this
whole universe came into existence by God releasing words. To
realize how much power is in God's Words, you have to
understand how much power God has.

All the power of God is behind His Word. Once He has spoken
something, God never changes His mind but causes His Word to be
fulfilled.

So don't lightly esteem the Word of God and think it is not a
powerful weapon. You just need to learn how to use it -- the
same as with any weapon.

There are spiritual forces arrayed against us. But God has not
left us without all we need to live in safety and victory. But
unless we "take" God's provision -- His Word -- and speak it
boldly against our enemy, we will be in trouble.

SAY THIS: I will use the spiritual weapon God has provided for
me, which is speaking His Word.
