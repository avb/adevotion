God Does Not Play Favorites

ROMANS 2:11 GWN
11 God does not play favorites.

God does not show favoritism. Several other translations say
"there is no partiality with God."

God does not practice discrimination with people, favoring one
above another. All of us have equal opportunity to receive
God's help and blessing. God loves everyone, but allows us to
choose whether to seek Him, or not.

Six times the Bible tells us that God does not show partiality
or favoritism.

2 CHRONICLES 19:7 NLT
7 Fear the LORD and judge with integrity, for the LORD our God
does not tolerate perverted justice, partiality, or the taking
of bribes."

ACTS 10:34 NLT
34 Then Peter replied, "I see very clearly that God shows no
favoritism.

ROMANS 2:11 NLT
11 For God does not show favoritism.

EPHESIANS 6:9 NLT
9 Masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Don't threaten
them; remember, you both have the same Master in heaven, and he
has no favorites.

COLOSSIANS 3:25 NLT
25 But if you do what is wrong, you will be paid back for the
wrong you have done. For God has no favorites.

1 PETER 1:17 NLT
17 And remember that the heavenly Father to whom you pray has
no favorites. He will judge or reward you according to what you
do. So you must live in reverent fear of him during your time
as "foreigners in the land."

God does not favor one person over another. Everyone has an
equal opportunity to receive God's blessing. No one is
excluded. The choice is ours. What God has done for others, He
will also do for you.

ROMANS 1:16 NLT
16 For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is
the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes -- the
Jew first and also the Gentile.

REVELATION 22:17 NLT
17 The Spirit and the bride say, "Come." Let anyone who hears
this say, "Come." Let anyone who is thirsty come. Let anyone
who desires drink freely from the water of life.

SAY THIS: God loves me just as much as He loves anyone.
