God Loves You

ROMANS 8:39 NLT
39 No power in the sky above or in the earth below -- indeed, 
nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from 
the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.

You may find it difficult to believe -- but it's true -- God 
loves you. His love for you is not based on your appearance or 
your performance -- but on the fact that you are His creation 
-- His child.

Just as a good parent loves their children, so God loves His
children -- and even more so. You will not be able to make God
stop loving you, no matter what you do or don't do. You can
displease Him, you can disappoint Him, you can anger Him -- but
you can't make Him stop loving you.

What are the practical consequences of God loving you? First,
it means you can trust Him. No one who truly loves you will
mistreat you. Second, it means God is doing all He can to help
you and bless you.

"Then why am I not more blessed, if God wants to bless me?"
Because you must cooperate with God to receive His blessing.
That is why we need continuing instruction from the Bible -- so
we can know how to receive all that God has for us.

The promise of Jesus is that if we continue in His Word it will
reveal the truth to us and make us free. That is the blessing
which God has provided for you through Christ because He loves
you: true freedom! Freedom from fear, freedom from confusion,
freedom from lack, freedom from sickness, freedom from strife,
freedom from sin.

SAY THIS: God loves me and desires the very best for me. That 
is why He gave me His Word, so I could know the truth and be 
free.
