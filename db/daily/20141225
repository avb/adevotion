Good Tidings Of Great Joy

LUKE 2:10-11 NKJ
10 Then the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid, for behold,
I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all
people.
11 "For there is born to you this day in the city of David a
Savior, who is Christ the Lord.

What kind of statement was this? "Great joy...to all people."?

Billions of people -- maybe two out of three on earth -- have
never even heard the "Gospel of Jesus Christ," or good news, as
the term gospel means.

Is this really for all people?

Yes, and we are supposed to tell them. God is a Savior -- one
who delivers and makes whole.

The true message of God is really good news. The kind of news
that people will get excited about when they truly understand
it.

If you say, "I don't see what there is to get so excited
about," then you don't yet understand the Gospel.

We are dealing with "good tidings of GREAT JOY -- which will be
to all people."

"So what's so great about it?"

Being made right with God as a free gift. Being set free from
the bondage of sin. Being delivered from the curse, including
sickness, poverty, and spiritual death. Being given new life
and brought into God's own family. Knowing that God is your
father and your friend...and so much more!

And all of this comes to us as a free gift simply by receiving
Jesus Christ!

SAY THIS: I have received Good News that will make people have
great joy!
