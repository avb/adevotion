God Is An Artist

EPHESIANS 2:10 NJB
10 We are God's work of art, created in Christ Jesus for the
good works which God has already designated to make up our way
of life.

Look around. See for yourself. God is an artist extraordinaire!

When we gaze at a beautiful sunset, or look at the infinitely
varied forms of life we find surrounding us, and realize that
God designed it all, it is easy to be impressed. God is an
artist. The most brilliant, creative artist ever to exist.

But when we look at our own lives and consider what God is
doing there, we tend to forget that God is an artist. He is
making something beautiful out of you and your life. You may
not see the beauty now -- you may not even see any design or
evidence that God is working -- but you will recognize it
someday.

God's intention for you is to be much more beautiful and
glorious than a sunset or a school of multi-colored fish. And
you will be! God will not fail.

"Wait a minute, preacher. I can see plenty of people that God
has failed on. They are anything but 'beautiful and glorious'
-- inwardly or outwardly."

Yes . . . today. But God is not finished. Many great works of
art take a long time. Don't judge too soon!

SAY THIS: God is a great artist and He is working on me.
