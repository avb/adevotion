The Greater One Is In You

1 JOHN 4:4 ICB
4 My dear children, you belong to God. So you have defeated
them because God's Spirit, who is in you, is greater than the
devil, who is in the world.

This message is simple and has two parts: God is greater than 
anything, and because you're a believer in Jesus Christ, He 
lives in you.

How can anyone argue with the fact that God is greater than any
problem? God, the Creator, is above ALL. Nothing is too
difficult for Him. Most people believe this.

The second part is more difficult to believe: God is in you.
Yet, that is the message of the Bible to believers.

JOHN 14:16-17 NKJ
16 "And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another
Helper, that He may abide with you forever--
17 "the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because
it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He
dwells with you and will be in you.

1 CORINTHIANS 6:19 NKJ
19 Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not
your own?

2 CORINTHIANS 6:16 NKJ
16 And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you
are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will
dwell in them And walk among them. I will be their God, And
they shall be My people."

Believe the Bible. The Greater One is in you. He is greater
than any problem. He is greater than any situation, any
difficulty, any obstacle, any enemy, any thing.

SAY THIS: The Greater One is in me. He is greater than anything
I now face or ever will face.
