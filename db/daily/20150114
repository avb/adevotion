By Faith We Receive From God

ROMANS 5:1-2 NKJ
1 Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with
God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
2 through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in
which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

All we receive from God is by His grace. We do not deserve it,
and we are not able to earn it. It is a gift offered by grace.

But we must access it by faith.

GALATIANS 3:14 NKJ
14 that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in
Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit
through faith.

We receive through faith. Whether we are receiving the Holy
Spirit or receiving healing. Whatever we receive from God must
be received by faith.

HEBREWS 6:12 NKJ
12 that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who
through faith and patience inherit the promises.

There are many promises in the Bible. If you want them to be
manifest in your life, you must possess them through faith and
patience.

MATTHEW 9:29 NKJ
29 Then He touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith
let it be to you."

This is the statement of Jesus. It is valid for you today just
as it was then. You will receive from God according to your faith.

Do not let this discourage you. Rather it should encourage you.
Although your faith may not be strong now, you can strengthen
it by feeding on the Word of God. It is under your control.

God's Word is faith food. The more you read it, speak it, and
hear it, the stronger your faith will grow.

SAY THIS: I will feed on God's Word and build my faith so I can
receive all the blessings God has for me.
