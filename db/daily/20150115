Words Are Spiritual Weapons

REVELATION 12:11 NKJ
11 "And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the
word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to
the death.

Words are more important than most people realize. All
authority is exercised through words.

When it comes to overcoming the enemy of our souls, and all his
tactics, we must speak words of faith in line with the Bible.

What Jesus did for you is enough. He defeated the devil for
you. However, you must enforce that defeat by speaking and
standing in agreement with God. Only then will you see Jesus'
victory manifest in your life.

EPHESIANS 6:17 NKJ
17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the
Spirit, which is the word of God;

A sword is a weapon. God's Word is not a weapon when laying on
your coffee table. It only becomes a spiritual weapon when you
speak it in faith.

You must take it. Your spiritual weapon is speaking the Word of
God. You must take the Word and speak it -- just like Jesus
did.

SAY THIS: I overcome by what Jesus did, and my words that
enforce that victory over the devil.
