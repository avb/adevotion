God's Covenant of Words

ISAIAH 59:21 NKJ
21 "As for Me," says the Lord, "this is My covenant with them:
My Spirit who is upon you, and My words which I have put in
your mouth, shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the
mouth of your descendants, nor from the mouth of your
descendants' descendants," says the Lord, "from this time and
forevermore."

According to Isaiah 59:21, part of our covenant with God
includes continually having His words in our mouth and in the
mouth of our descendants. Not only are we to speak God's Word,
but we are to train our descendants to do the same.

God must know something about the importance of the words we
speak, that we have not yet understood.

Although a growing number of believers are beginning to realize
the importance of the words we speak, the vast majority of
Christians have never heard any teaching on this subject. Yet,
if you search the Bible, you will see that God puts a major
emphasis on what we say.

1 PETER 4:11 NIV
11 If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very
words of God....

Look at the Bible for yourself. Decide for yourself. You will
surely decide that the Bible teaches that believers should
speak words in agreement with what God says.

What you say IS important.

SAY THIS: I will speak words in agreement with what God has
said, and I will teach my descendants to do likewise.
