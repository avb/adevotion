Walk In Love

EPHESIANS 4:31-32 NCV
31 Do not be bitter or angry or mad. Never shout angrily or say 
things to hurt others. Never do anything evil.
32 Be kind and loving to each other, and forgive each other 
just as God forgave you in Christ.

As a human who has been hurt, you may find it impossible to
forgive and walk in love. But as a child of God, with God
helping you, you can do it.

God freely forgave you. Now, with His love placed in your
heart, you are to act like Him and forgive others.

EPHESIANS 5:1-2 NIV
1 Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children
2 and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave
himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.

Putting others first is the essence of walking in love.
Selfishness is the opposite of walking in divine love.

COLOSSIANS 3:12-13 NIV
12 Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved,
clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility,
gentleness and patience.
13 Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may
have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.

If you are having trouble with this, just ask the Lord to work
in you and change you. Tell Him you need help.

SAY THIS: I can walk in love because the Lord is my Helper.
