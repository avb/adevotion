The Joy Of The Lord Is Your Strength

NEHEMIAH 8:10 NLT
10 . . . Don't be dejected and sad, for the joy of the LORD is
your strength!"

I do not claim it is the only meaning, but one thing the Lord
showed me from this verse is that our level of joy is like a
thermometer revealing our spiritual strength. If our joy is low
-- our spiritual strength is low. That is because the Lord is
our strength, and in His presence there is fullness of joy.

PSALM 16:11 NKJ
11 You will show me the path of life; In Your presence is
fullness of joy; At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.

So, if our joy is low, it means we have not been spending time
in God's presence, receiving His strength and help. It means we
have got our focus off God and onto something else.

(Although God is always with us, as we worship Him and praise
Him and thank Him, God manifests His presence.)

Being gloomy is not a sign of being spiritual. God did not
intend for His people to be downcast. Let the world be sad, we
have something to rejoice about! Jesus! Heaven!

If you look at your circumstances you may not feel like
rejoicing. But if you look at Jesus as He truly is -- you will
not be able to keep from rejoicing in Him. Jesus is wonderful!

PHILIPPIANS 4:4 NLT
4 Always be full of joy in the Lord. I say it again -- rejoice!

SAY THIS: I will rejoice in the Lord!
