You Can Do What You Cannot Do

Let's look at two people from the Bible who did the impossible.
But they did it anyway, because of God's involvement.

HEBREWS 11:11 NKJ
11 By faith Sarah herself also received strength to conceive
seed, and she bore a child when she was past the age, because
she judged Him faithful who had promised.

Sarah had a child when she was 91 years old. (Genesis 17:17-21)
Physically, it was impossible. She had long since lost the
ability to bear children.

But she did what she could not do.

Sarah achieved this impossibility because of God's promise, and
because she believed God would keep His promise.

JUDGES 15:14-15 NKJ
14 When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting against
him. Then the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him; and
the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that is burned
with fire, and his bonds broke loose from his hands.
15 He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand
and took it, and killed a thousand men with it.

Samson killed 1000 of the Lord's enemies with a bone.

He did what he could not do.

No human being is capable of single-handedly killing 1000
people at one time, with no weapon but a bone. No matter how
strong or skilled any man may be, he could easily be overcome
by such superior numbers.

But with God's anointing and help -- the situation is
different.

With God helping you: you have God's ability to do God's will.
You can do whatever God's Word says you should do.

Your sufficiency is of God.

Whatever God wants you to do -- He will help you. God does not
play favorites. Just as He helped Samson and Sarah to do what
they could not do -- He will help you to do His will -- even if
"it is impossible."

Without the anointing and help of the Lord, you cannot. But
with God -- all things are possible.

SAY THIS: I can do whatever God wants me to do. Nothing is
impossible.
