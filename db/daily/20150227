Jesus Became Poor . . .

2 CORINTHIANS 8:9 NKJ
9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though
He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you
through His poverty might become rich.

Most people know that Jesus became poor. They just don't know
why.

Some people may tell you this verse refers only to being made
"spiritually rich." Don't fall for that. Look at the context
and you will see it is discussing money.

"Then why aren't Christians rich?"

The main reason is because of a lack of teaching on this
subject. Everything we receive from God must be received by
faith. If we don't believe it, we won't receive it.

(Jesus died so that everyone could be saved. However, until
people hear the message and believe it, they continue lost in
their sins. Yet the price has already been paid by Jesus for
their freedom.)

Instead of teaching that prosperity is a blessing available to
believers, most churches have taught the opposite -- that it
was the will of God for us to be poor.

What we need is to hear preaching and teaching about it being
God's will for us to prosper. We need to continue in the Word
on that subject, to be set free in that area of life.

I am NOT saying being prosperous makes you a better person, or
that it is a sign of great faith. I AM saying that poverty and
lack is part of the curse -- which Jesus redeemed us from.

God's prosperity is a growing thing that will not destroy you,
unlike winning the lottery, or other get-rich-quick schemes.
Time and continued obedience to God are required.

But the fact remains, according to Scripture, Jesus became poor
to set you free from poverty -- to make you rich.

SAY THIS: Jesus became poor to make me rich.
