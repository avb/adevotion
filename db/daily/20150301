All The Promises Of God

2 CORINTHIANS 1:20 NCV
20 The yes to all of God's promises is in Christ, and through
Christ we say yes to the glory of God.

Although the entire Bible is a message to us today, not all of
it is written directly to us.

The New Testament epistles are written directly to us who are
in the church, the Body of Christ, which includes all
believers.

We do need to rightly divide the Bible, but since all the
promises of God are yes in Christ -- they find their
fulfillment in Him -- we can take any promise of blessing in
the entire Bible and appropriate it by faith.

God has blessed us with every blessing in Christ!

EPHESIANS 1:3 NKJ
3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly
places in Christ,

Every promise in the Bible is not directed to us specifically.
But, by faith in Jesus Christ, we can appropriate every
blessing God has to offer.

When we do receive the promised blessings of God's Word, it
brings glory to God.

All this is not automatic. You have to actively receive. But
the main "activity" involved with receiving blessing from God
is believing. To truly believe you need evidence. That's why
you need to read and study the Bible.

SAY THIS: Every Bible promise of blessing is mine in Christ.
