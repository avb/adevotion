Be A Minister

2 CORINTHIANS 3:5-6 NIV
5 Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for
ourselves, but our competence comes from God.
6 He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant -- 
not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but 
the Spirit gives life.

A minister's job is turning people to God.

No one has to appoint you, ordain you, or give you credentials
to make you a minister.

A minister is one who serves -- serves God, and people, by
turning people to God so they can receive help.

Being a minister does not require you to have a title such as
pastor, bishop, or priest.

While it is true that God does call some to special places of
ministry, it is a mistake to think that we all cannot, or
should not, minister.

A minister is a middle-man like a real estate agent. A person
can find out about God on their own with a Bible, just like
someone can buy a house directly, but it is easier and faster
to have a more experienced person who knows the territory help
you.

Someone who helps another is a minister. You can do that.

SAY THIS: God made me able to minister -- to help someone.
