Accept God's Acceptance

God accepts you, because of what Jesus did as your substitute,
and because He loves you.

EPHESIANS 1:6 NKJ
6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He has made
us accepted in the Beloved.

All barriers between you and God were broken down by Jesus
Christ. God forgave you, and offers cleansing from all the sin
you ever committed.

2 CORINTHIANS 5:18-21 NLT
18 All this newness of life is from God, who brought us back to
himself through what Christ did. And God has given us the task
of reconciling people to him.
19 For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no
longer counting people's sins against them. This is the
wonderful message he has given us to tell others.
20 We are Christ's ambassadors, and God is using us to speak to
you. We urge you, as though Christ himself were here pleading
with you, "Be reconciled to God!"
21 For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering
for our sin, so that we could be made right with God through
Christ.

God's intention is to have a family -- a loving family. He
wants you to be a part of it.

ROMANS 15:7 NCV
7 Christ accepted you, so you should accept each other, which
will bring glory to God.

SAY THIS: I accept that God has forgiven me and accepted me
into His family.
