According To Your Faith

MATTHEW 9:29 NKJ
29 Then He touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith
let it be to you."

God responds to faith.

God blesses people who have faith.

Don't you appreciate people who have faith in you? Well, God
appreciates people who have faith in Him.

But His reason is not selfish -- as ours may be. God knows His 
ways are right and bring blessing, while protecting people from 
harm. So, when we have faith in God, we will follow His 
instructions, and the world will be a better place.

When everyone has faith in God, and follows His way of love,
the world will be a perfect place.

Many people don't understand God because they think He should
respond to need, instead of responding to faith.

God doesn't do that because it doesn't work. Meeting human need
without them having faith in God brings no lasting benefit.

MATTHEW 8:13 NKJ
13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way; and as you
have believed, so let it be done for you." And his servant was
healed that same hour.

SAY THIS: God responds to my faith.
