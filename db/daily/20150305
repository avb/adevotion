Faith And Patience

HEBREWS 6:12 NKJ
12 that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who
through faith and patience inherit the promises.

Patience is not just putting up with things.

Patience means to continue, to persevere, to stay steady, to
maintain your course, to not grow weary in doing good and quit.

Patience is a fruit of the spirit, so to walk in Bible patience
you must keep your spiritual life strong, by feeding on the
Word and fellowshiping with God.

We receive from God by faith, but our faith has to be
undergirded by patience to possess and enjoy His promises.

It's normal for there to be a time of waiting and testing when
we believe the promises of God. But hang on to your faith and
it will see you through.

JAMES 5:10-11 NIV
10 Brothers, as an example of patience in the face of
suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
11 As you know, we consider blessed those who have persevered.
You have heard of Job's perseverance and have seen what the
Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and
mercy.

God's Word will come to pass in your life. Don't quit
believing.

Hang in there!

SAY THIS: I will imitate those who through faith and patience
inherit the promises of God.
