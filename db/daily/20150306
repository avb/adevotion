Make Friends Of Enemies

PROVERBS 25:21-22 LB
21-22 If your enemy is hungry, give him food! If he is thirsty,
give him something to drink! This will make him feel ashamed of
himself, and God will reward you.

Why would anyone want to be an enemy of someone who treated
them well?

Your actions should cause your enemy to reconsider being your
enemy.

When you treat your enemies well, not only do you have a good
chance of making them friends, but also God will reward you.

ROMANS 12:19-21 LB
19 Dear friends, never avenge yourselves. Leave that to God,
for he has said that he will repay those who deserve it. [Don't
take the law into your own hands.]
20 Instead, feed your enemy if he is hungry. If he is thirsty
give him something to drink and you will be "heaping coals of
fire on his head." In other words, he will feel ashamed of
himself for what he has done to you.
21 Don't let evil get the upper hand, but conquer evil by doing
good.

The way to turn an enemy into a friend is to treat them in a
friendly manner.

This is God's plan. It should be your plan, too.

SAY THIS: Treat enemies like friends and you won't have any
enemies.
