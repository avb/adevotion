Faith Is The Victory

1 JOHN 5:4 NKJ
4 For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is
the victory that has overcome the world -- our faith.

We all love to win.

Victory is sweet. One reason it's so sweet is that it's usually
not easy. Victory takes effort -- often great effort.

Effort is also required in the spiritual battle of good against
evil we are all engaged in. But the effort required of us is to
maintain our attitude of faith in God and His Word.

We cannot overcome the strategies of the devil by our
willpower, or by our own strength. We must use the spiritual
weapons God has provided for us.

As a child of God -- you are a winner! The victory is already
yours through what Jesus Christ did on your behalf. Don't let
the enemy steal the victory away from you.

Your enemy comes to steal your faith. Don't let it happen.

SAY THIS: I overcome and walk in victory by my faith in God.
