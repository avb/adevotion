God Is The Original Parent

EPHESIANS 3:15 AMPLIFIED
15 For Whom every family in heaven and on earth is named--
[that Father] from Whom all fatherhood takes its title and
derives its name.

Barclay translates verse 15, "of whose fatherhood all heavenly
and earthly fatherhood is a copy,".

A note in the Translator's N.T. says, "A play on Greek words is
involved here. The meaning is that the whole human idea of
family and fatherhood owes its origin to God the Father."

The Tyndale N.T. Commentary says, "He is also the One from whom
alone all the fatherhood that there is derives its meaning and
inspiration.  From Him it derives its existence and its
concept...."

What does this all mean?

God is the original Father, the original parent, and everything
good that has ever been in any parent is just a copy of what
was first in God.

God looks upon you as a good parent looks upon their child.

PSALM 103:13 BECK
13 As a father loves His children, so the LORD loves those who
fear Him.

According to the experts, love in Psalm 103:13 means "deep
love, cherishing, to behold with tenderest affection."

There has never been a parent who loved their child more than
God loves you.

SAY THIS: Thank you God, for being my Father, and loving me.
