Should Poor People Give?

ACTS 20:35 NIV
35 . . . the Lord Jesus himself said: `It is more blessed to
give than to receive.'"

Giving benefits the giver. The poorer you are the more you have
a need to give.

Those who don't understand giving as planting seeds usually
think it's wrong for a poor person to give to God. But giving
is planting seed for a harvest.

2 CORINTHIANS 9:6-8 NKJ
6 But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap
sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap
bountifully.
7 So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not
grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.
8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that
you, always having all sufficiency in all things, have an
abundance for every good work.

LUKE 6:38 NKJ
38 "Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed
down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your
bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it will be
measured back to you."

By giving, seed is planted for a larger harvest of blessing.
Nobody needs that more than a poor person.

Jesus commended a poor widow for giving all she had.

LUKE 21:1-4 NKJ
1 Then He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into
the treasury,
2 and He saw also a certain poor widow putting in two mites.
3 So He said, "Truly I say to you that this poor widow has put
in more than all;
4 "for all these out of their abundance have put in offerings
for God, but she out of her poverty has put in all the
livelihood that she had."

SAY THIS: Giving is a way to be blessed.
