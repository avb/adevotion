You Have Authority Over The Devil

LUKE 10:19 NKJ
19 "Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and
scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing
shall by any means hurt you.

Jesus defeated the devil for you. According to Matthew 28:18,
all authority on Earth now belongs to Jesus. As His earthly
representatives, Jesus has delegated His authority to us in
certain ways.

MARK 16:17 NKJ
17 "And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name
they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;

All believers have authority to use the Name of Jesus Christ.
In Jesus' Name, or authority, we can cast out the devil and all
his forces.

PHILIPPIANS 2:10 NKJ
10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in
heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth,

After Jesus' resurrection, Scripture clearly puts
responsibility on the believer to exercise the delegated
authority of Jesus to resist the devil, and all his works.

EPHESIANS 4:27 NKJ
27 nor give place to the devil.

JAMES 4:7 NKJ
7 ...submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.

1 PETER 5:8-9 NKJ
8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks
about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.
9 Resist him, steadfast in the faith,....

You can resist the devil and not allow him any place in your
life, because you have authority over the devil.

SAY THIS: In Christ, I have authority over the devil, all his
forces, and all his works.
