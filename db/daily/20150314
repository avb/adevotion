You Can Cast Out Demons

MARK 16:17 NKJ
17 "And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name
they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;

A demon is a member of the devil's forces. Any Christian can
cast out demons, because all believers have authority over
demons in Jesus' Name.

PHILIPPIANS 2:10 NKJ
10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in
heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth,

All believers have the delegated authority to use the Name of
Jesus -- at which every knee shall bow in submission.

Demons operate through fear. But you don't have to be afraid,
because Jesus is backing you up. So, when you command demons to
leave in the Name of Jesus, they must obey you.

Don't limit this to casting out demons from "demon-possessed"
people. If there is demonic activity in any area of life
affecting you, use your authority in Christ and throw the
demons out in Jesus' Name. Command them to cease their
activities and stop their operations against you.

How do you know if something is demonic? If it steals, kills,
or destroys -- it certainly is not of God! (See John 10:10.)

JAMES 4:7 NKJ
7 . . . Resist the devil and he will flee from you.

EPHESIANS 4:27 NKJ
27 nor give place to the devil.

The Bible tells you to not give any place to the devil, and to 
resist him, so it is obvious you can do so. If the devil, or 
his forces, have a place in your life, it means you are 
allowing it.

SAY THIS: I can cast out demons, in Jesus' Name.
