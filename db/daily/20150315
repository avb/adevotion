Focus On Jesus

True Christianity is not a religion based on rules and rituals,
but a living relationship with Jesus Christ.

Many people reduce Christianity down to attending church
meetings and trying not to commit a list of certain sins.

But being a Christian is being united with Jesus, a member of
His body, with His life in your heart.

Jesus should be your focus -- not religious activity -- but the
person of Jesus, the Lord and Christ.

1 CORINTHIANS 1:9 NIV
9 God, who has called you into fellowship with his Son Jesus
Christ our Lord, is faithful.

Church meetings, Bible reading, etc. can be good, but should
not be allowed to become an end in themselves. They are tools
to help us know Jesus and walk more closely with Him.

The Bible says we are to be faithful; but faithful to what: a
religious system, an organization -- or, a Person? Are you
serving Jesus -- or serving something else as His substitute?

The focus of your life should be to please Jesus.

COLOSSIANS 1:18 NRSV
18 He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning,
the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have
first place in everything.

Does Jesus have first place in your life? In your schedule? If
not, why not?

In everything, Jesus should be central.

SAY THIS: I will keep my focus on Jesus Christ.
