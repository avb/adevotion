Hang On To Your Faith

The devil's whole strategy is to get you to turn loose of your
faith in God and His Word.

MARK 4:15 NIV
15 Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is
sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the
word that was sown in them.

How can the devil steal the Word from someone? Only when it
seems untrue. People don't turn loose of what they believe is
true.

So, to steal the Word, the devil must convince people it's not
true. The devil does this by getting us to focus on what our
senses tell us, instead of on God's Word, the seed which
changes our circumstances when we retain it.

As with any seed, the full manifestation of its life is not
apparent immediately, but manifests over time with the proper
care. God's Word will change your circumstances!

If you don't believe God's Word, you won't act on it. Without
following God's instructions, you will not be made free (see
John 8:31-32).

Actions cannot be separated from believing. Whatever you are
acting on is what you really believe.

In the New Testament, "faith" is the noun and "believe" is the
verb form of the same Greek word. So, hanging on to your faith
means to keep believing what God said -- regardless of
circumstances.

HEBREWS 10:23 KJV
23 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without
wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)

A key to hanging on to your faith is found in what you say.
When you speak of fear and doubt, faith shrivels. But when you
speak faith words in line with the Bible, your faith grows
strong.

The devil tries to get you to doubt God and His Word. The devil
wants you to give up on God, to not trust Him, to not expect
Him to do what He said in His Word. Do not give up! God can be
trusted.

SAY THIS: I will keep on believing and acting on God's Word.
