Rejoice In Trouble

Life can be hard.

Maybe you have been forsaken by your spouse. Or are struggling
with the death of a loved one. Or facing the constant pain of
disease. Or the loss of a job or business. Or, maybe just the
daily grind of life.

What can you do? You always have choices. You choose how you
respond. With God's help, you don't have to let the problems of
life defeat you.

A prophet named Habakkuk had the attitude we all need:

HABAKKUK 3:17-18 NIV
17 Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on
the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce
no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in
the stalls,
18 yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will be joyful in God my
Savior.

Even if everything seems to go wrong, you can rejoice in the
Lord, for He is good and His mercy endures forever!

There is no darkness so dark that Jesus cannot overcome. There
is no situation that is hopeless. There is no problem too big
for God to fix.

When you face trouble in life, will you whine and complain, or
will you rejoice in God?

Maybe I should ask, "Would you prefer to get better or to get
worse?"

As you rejoice in the Lord, you will find strength to go on and
face life. God will give you strength to overcome.

We all face struggles in life. Focusing on God -- who has the
solution to every problem -- is a way out of the jaws of defeat
into glorious victory.

Whatever your struggle is, look to God. Rejoice in Him!

Don't let the devil steal your joy. Rejoice in the Lord!

PHILIPPIANS 4:4 NIV
4 Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!

SAY THIS: I will rejoice in God even when I face trouble.
