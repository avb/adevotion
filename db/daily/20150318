Imitate God

Did you know that the Bible tells you to imitate God?

It surely does!

EPHESIANS 5:1-2 NIV
1 Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children and
live a life of love,
2 just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a
fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.

No doubt you have seen a child imitating their parent.
Sometimes the parent is glad -- sometimes embarrassed.

Just as earthly children imitate their parents, children of God
are supposed to imitate their Heavenly Father.

In what way are we to imitate God? Should we try to create
planets? (You're probably not quite ready for that! But who
knows about the future.)

We are to imitate God by walking in love instead of
selfishness. By being givers instead of takers.

SAY THIS: I will imitate God my Heavenly Father, and walk in
love.
