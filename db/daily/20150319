The Benefit Of Prayer

ISAIAH 40:31 NKJ
31 But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength;
they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and
not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.

Most people look at prayer only as asking God for things. If
that defines your prayer life, you are really missing out.

Prayer is communication with God -- the greatest privilege on
earth.

Prayer is visiting with God. It can include asking for things,
but is primarily spending time in God's presence, soaking up
His life, His wisdom, and His strength.

Isaiah reveals an important truth to us: those who spend time
with God get new strength. Literally, they exchange strength
with Him. When we spend time with God He somehow takes away our
weakness and replaces it with His strength. What a deal!

As we spend time focused on God, in His presence, we are also
changed into His likeness.

2 CORINTHIANS 3:18 NKJ
18 But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the
glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image...

So, if you need more strength to face life, if you want to be
more like God, or if you want to develop a closer relationship
with the most amazing Being in the universe -- prayer is your
answer.

Don't worry about knowing the right words or being formal. Just
talk to God as you would to a well-respected friend.

SAY THIS: Excuse me, I think I'll visit with God.
