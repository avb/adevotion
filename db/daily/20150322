Jesus' Invitation

REVELATION 3:20 NKJ
20 "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My
voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with
him, and he with Me.

Most people think this verse is directed to non-believers. Not
so. Jesus was talking to those already in the church.

How sad!

This is the Lord, the Head of the church, speaking to His own
people. "If you will open up to Me, we will enjoy times of
fellowship."

God desires your fellowship. He wants you to spend time with
Him. But He invites -- He never forces.

We enjoy the presence of those who love us, especially when we
also love them. God loves you more than anyone else does. So,
you shouldn't need to be forced, or talked into, spending time
in fellowship with God.

1 CORINTHIANS 1:9 NIV
9 God, who has called you into fellowship with his Son Jesus
Christ our Lord, is faithful.

God has called you. You must choose whether to answer.

Who would you rather know than God?

Spending time with someone is the way you get to know them. You
begin to know what they like and dislike, and how they think.
When you spend time with the Lord in His Word and prayer, you
get to know Him.

Spending time with someone is the only way to build a
relationship.

SAY THIS: Jesus, I open up the door to You!
