When To Rejoice

1 THESSALONIANS 5:16 KJV
16 Rejoice evermore.

1 THESSALONIANS 5:16 NASB
16 Rejoice always;

If you only rejoice when things are perfect, you may not
rejoice much in this life.

Why miss out on something so pleasant?

ROMANS 12:12 NRSV
12 Rejoice in hope, be patient in suffering, persevere in
prayer.

You can rejoice in hope! That means to rejoice ahead of time.

Why? Because you expect deliverance. You know God's blessing is
coming your way -- because God is faithful. So rejoice now!

PHILIPPIANS 4:4 NIV
4 Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!

God never changes. He's always good. Focus on Him and you will
have something to rejoice about.

SAY THIS: I will rejoice in the Lord always.
