Jesus Is Lord

ACTS 2:36 NKJ
36 "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God
has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ."

Many preachers tell people they "need to make Jesus Lord."

While I understand what they're trying to say -- it's too late!

Jesus ALREADY is Lord! God made Jesus the Lord almost 2000
years ago.

ACTS 10:36 NKJ
36 "The word which God sent to the children of Israel, preaching
peace through Jesus Christ--He is Lord of all--

What we must do is recognize and agree that Jesus is Lord. The
Bible calls this "confessing," which certainly involves more
than just glibly speaking a few words.

ROMANS 10:9 NKJ
9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in
your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.

We need to realize we're not the center of the Universe, but
Jesus Christ is, and therefore, we should submit to His
Lordship, instead of trying to run our own lives.

But we don't really "make Him Lord" -- we just yield to His
Lordship.

No matter what it may seem like at times, Jesus Christ is Lord.
He is ruler, boss, king: the One ultimately in charge.

It's true that Jesus has not yet exercised His prerogative and
taken charge of everything that's His by virtue of being Lord
of all -- but that's only a temporary situation.

PHILIPPIANS 2:10-11 NKJ
10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in
heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth,
11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father.

Eventually, everyone will know the truth. You have the great
privilege of knowing it, and acting on it, today.

Jesus is Lord!

SAY THIS: God made Jesus to be Lord, and I accept His Lordship
over my life, and over all creation.
