Temporary!

This is what you should say to your circumstances when they
don't line up with God's Word:

Temporary!

2 CORINTHIANS 4:18 NIV
18 So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is
unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is
eternal.

You may not realize it -- but problems often "speak" to you.
They say things like, "You can't get rid of me. I'll be with
you as long as you live."

"Your parents died from this and you will, too."

"Your family was poor and you'll always be poor. You'll never
have abundance. You'll never get out of debt."

Actually, it's the demonic forces behind the problems that
speak to our minds -- trying to keep us in doubt and unbelief.
We must resist those thoughts -- and the first step is to talk
back!

We should speak to thoughts of doubt and unbelief that are
contrary to what God has said in His Word -- for His Word is
truth.

Don't be passive. Resist!

The Bible tells us to resist the devil. That means to resist
his thoughts and ideas, too.

Long ago, God gave mankind dominion on earth. That dominion
included naming things. You still have that form of dominion
today. If you name your troubles as "yours" and "permanent" --
they will stay. But if you call them "temporary" -- they will
eventually leave.

Jesus told us to speak to our mountains and tell them to be
gone. But what should you say after you have spoken to the
mountain and it's still there?:

TEMPORARY!

SAY THIS: My circumstances are subject to change!
