Make Prayer A Habit

ROMANS 12:12 NRSV
12 Rejoice in hope, be patient in suffering, persevere in
prayer.

Prayer is a habit that, like every other good habit, must be
developed.

You know you need to pray. You need God's help, His wisdom and
His guidance. But you must persevere in prayer. The activities
of life try to keep you from praying. So persevere!

LUKE 21:36 BBE
36 But keep watch at all times with prayer, that you may be
strong enough to come through all these things and take your
place before the Son of man.

In communing with God, you gain strength that comes in no other
way. You find the wisdom and courage to face life and overcome.

1 THESSALONIANS 5:17-18 ICB
17 Never stop praying.
18 Give thanks whatever happens. That is what God wants for you
in Christ Jesus.

Learn to always include God in your thoughts. Ask Him about
everything. Cultivate your relationship by continual
communication. And one of the most important things for you to
communicate to God is your gratitude. Thank God for everything.

Don't relegate prayer to just when you're on your knees. As you
go about your activities, include God by constant communion
with Him.

Talk to God about everything!

SAY THIS: Lord, help me to develop the habit of continual
communication with you.
