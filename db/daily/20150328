Selfishness

The only thing necessary to change heaven into hell -- if God
were to allow it -- is selfishness.

Selfishness is mankind's fundamental defect. Selfish means:
self-centered, self-serving, self-important.

At the root of every problem is selfishness.

JAMES 3:16 TEV
16 Where there is jealousy and selfishness, there is also
disorder and every kind of evil.

Every selfish person is potentially your enemy.

All sin is selfish. No one ever sins for someone else -- we do
it for selfish reasons.

Divine love is the opposite of selfishness. Giving is the
opposite of acting selfishly.

We are products of a corrupt culture that teaches selfishness,
so it's not unusual for us to think it's not so bad.

But you must die to selfishness -- or self-destruct. However,
you're unable to change by yourself. You can't change the fruit
without changing the root. That's why you must be born again!
Only by receiving Jesus Christ and letting Him change you
inwardly can you become a truly unselfish person.

No other "religion" teaches putting others first even to the 
point of loving your enemies. Only Christianity teaches you can 
be totally changed and become a person with a new nature. There 
is no cure apart from Jesus!

SAY THIS: Jesus, please cure me of being selfish.
