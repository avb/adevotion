Pride and Selfishness

PHILIPPIANS 2:3-4 NKJ
3 Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but
in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than
himself.
4 Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but
also for the interests of others.

Pride and selfishness always go together. A truly humble person
cannot be selfish.

Pride is self-importance and self-focus -- which leads to
selfishness which is selfish thinking and selfish acting -- the
opposite of Jesus' command of agape love in John 13:34.

Pride produces selfishness. All selfishness is a manifestation
of pride -- thinking you are better, or more important, than
others.

Pride is the root of selfishness -- and thus the root of all
evil. Pride is hidden but manifests as selfish acts.

JAMES 3:16 TEV
16 Where there is jealousy and selfishness, there is also
disorder and every kind of evil.

Selfishness causes all evil. All evil proceeds from selfish
actions. Selfishness is the only manifest problem, but pride
feeds it. Dealing with the root cause of the problem is the
only lasting solution.

Submitting to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, and realizing we
are not the center of the Universe, is the answer.

Without Jesus, you can do nothing. Apart from His grace, you
would not be able to take that next breath of air!

SAY THIS: Jesus is Lord and I submit to Him.
