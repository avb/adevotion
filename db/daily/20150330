Do You Want To Be Happy?

What are you waiting for?

Most people are waiting for something -- something "special"
that will make their life great, so they can be happy.

Ask yourself: have others had this, and are they all happy? No,
they're not, and it won't give you lasting happiness, either.

Happiness is not determined by external circumstances, but by
internal circumstances.

Everyone chooses how happy they are by what they choose to
think about.

Your attitude is determined by your perspective, which is
determined by what you think about -- your focus. You choose
your focus, so ultimately, you are the one who chooses whether
to be happy, or not.

Perspective is what the Beatitudes (Matthew 5) are about.
Seeing a bigger picture than just this one small moment of
time. (The Beatitudes are where Jesus explained how some are
blessed, or happy -- even in difficult situations.)

(The word we translate as "happy" in the New Testament is
usually translated as "blessed.")

You won't get happiness by chasing what the world has to offer.
It has already been tried and found wanting.

And, you will never be happy as long as you are self-centered.
A focus on self is guaranteed to prevent happiness.

Right after Jesus performed the menial task of washing his
disciple's feet -- akin to cleaning toilets today -- He told
them:

JOHN 13:15,17 ICB
15 I did this as an example for you. So you should do as I have
done for you.
17 If you know these things, you will be happy if you do them.

You will be happy if you help others. If you take your focus
off yourself. That's what Jesus taught.

SAY THIS: I choose to focus on God and be thankful and happy.
