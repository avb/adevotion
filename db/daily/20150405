Redeemed By His Blood

1 PETER 1:18-19 NKJ
18 knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things,
like silver or gold . . .
19 but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
blemish and without spot.

Some Christians shy away from talking about blood -- but not
the Bible. In fact, the Bible presents blood as an integral and
honored part of Christian teaching.

Blood represents life, and Jesus freely gave His life to redeem
you.

COLOSSIANS 1:13-14 NKJ
13 He has delivered us from the power of darkness and
translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love,
14 in whom we have redemption through His blood, the
forgiveness of sins.

The blood of Jesus -- representing the giving of His life --
was the payment for your freedom. You should give bold
testimony to the power of the precious Blood of Jesus. It is
what has set you free!

Sin opens the door for the devil. But Jesus' Blood cleanses us
from all sin and closes the door of opportunity to the devil.

1 JOHN 1:9 NKJ
9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us
our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

Jesus' Blood enables us to stand before God as if sin had never
existed. We have no other plea for entrance into God's presence
but the precious Blood of the Lamb.

HEBREWS 10:19 NKJ
19 Therefore, brethren, having boldness to enter the Holiest by
the blood of Jesus,

The blood of Jesus represents all that God accomplished for you
in His great redemption.

We should display the token of Jesus' Blood over the boundaries
of our lives -- anywhere the devil might have an opening -- by
releasing our faith in the sufficiency of that precious Blood
through words.

SAY THIS: I am set free by the Blood of Jesus Christ.
