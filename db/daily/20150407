The Deceitfulness of Riches

MATTHEW 13:22 NIV
22 The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is
the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and
the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful.

How are riches deceitful? (The word really means a delusion.)

Riches promise more than they can deliver. They promise
security, happiness, and satisfaction in life, but fail to
deliver.

Does this mean God is against wealth? No! He just doesn't want
you to be deceived by it. Or, to trust in it. For it will
surely disappoint you.

1 TIMOTHY 6:17 NKJ
17 Command those who are rich in this present age not to be
haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living
God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy.

According to Jesus, life does not consist of the abundance of
one's possessions. You should believe Him. He knows.

LUKE 12:15 NASB
15 And He said to them, "Beware, and be on your guard against
every form of greed; for not {even} when one has an abundance
does his life consist of his possessions."

Watch out! Don't let money deceive you.

Having wealth -- a bunch of stuff -- will not give you a
satisfying, fulfilling life. It promises to. But it can't
deliver.

Things will not make you happy -- not for long. It's your
inward attitude, and doing God's will, that determines whether
you will enjoy happiness in life.

If having more money was the answer, why do rich people commit
suicide?

Money promises security, but can never quite attain it. In
contrast, God delivers security -- for eternity.

HEBREWS 13:5 NIV
5 Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content
with what you have, because God has said, "Never will I leave
you; never will I forsake you."

Money can leave you and forsake you, even when you need it
most. But God will never abandon you.

Riches will let you down. God never will.

SAY THIS: Thank you Lord for opening my eyes to the
deceitfulness of riches.
