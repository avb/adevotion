God's Word Is A Seed

Most people expect God's Word to work like a stick of dynamite
-- but Jesus told us God's Word is like a seed.

LUKE 8:11 NKJ
11 "Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

The Holy Spirit, through Peter, also said God's Word is a seed.

1 PETER 1:23 NKJ
23 having been born again, not of corruptible seed but
incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides
forever,

God's Word is alive. Just like a seed -- the Bible is full of
unseen life.

JOHN 6:63 ICB
63 It is not the flesh that gives a person life. It is the
spirit that gives life. The words I told you are spirit, and so
they give life.

Jesus said His words are alive. They contain life, so they give
life. The words in your Bible may look lifeless and powerless.
Seeds do, also. But they are not without life or power.

In Mark 4:30-31, Jesus explained that the kingdom of God works
like a seed. So, if we are to understand God's kingdom and how
He operates, we need to understand seeds.

SAY THIS: God's Word is good seed. I will plant it in my life
and it will bring forth a good harvest.
