You Must Control The Devil

JAMES 4:7 NKJ
7 Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee
from you.

Most believers expect God to control the devil, but God gave
you that responsibility.

EPHESIANS 4:27 NKJ
27 nor give place to the devil.

Would God tell you not to let the devil have any place, if you
had no say about it? If the devil does have a place in your
affairs, it's because you allow it.

The devil will take over -- if you let him.

Jesus won the victory. It legally belongs to you. But the devil 
is a criminal, who doesn't obey the law unless forced to. You 
must enforce Jesus' victory and Lordship in the situations of 
life, or the devil will take control by default.

No human being, in themselves, is any match for the devil. So
you can't resist him in your own ability or name. You are not
more powerful than the devil, but you do have more authority as
a believer in Jesus Christ.

Just as a policeman in uniform has the backing of the entire
government and all its forces, so believers have the backing of
God and all His forces, when we stand against the devil in
Jesus' Name.

God gave you authority to resist the devil, and expects you to
use it. If you disobey God by not using it, things will not go
very well in your life.

Praying to God to stop the devil's operations is no different
than my son asking me to take out the trash, after I told him
to do it.

God told us to resist the devil and he would flee. We must
believe and act on God's Word.

SAY THIS: I will resist the devil and he will flee from me.
