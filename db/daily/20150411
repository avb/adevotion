Why Pray?

JOHN 15:5 NKJ
5 "I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me,
and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do
nothing.

There are three reasons to pray: for God's benefit, for your
benefit, and for the benefit of others.

To Benefit God

Just as earthly parents enjoy talking with their child, our
Heavenly Father enjoys hearing from you.

Also, God desires certain things done on Earth, but He has
delegated authority to mankind. Through our requests, God can
justly intervene in earthly situations and bring His will to
pass. So, praying in line with God's Word benefits God.

To Benefit You

Prayer is communication with God. It includes listening,
discussion, and giving thanks -- not just asking for things.

Relationship requires communication. Your relationship with the
Lord will never grow without communication.

Time spent in prayer helps you stay tuned-in spiritually --
remaining sensitive to God. Prayer keeps you "connected" with
God. It helps keep your focus on God and how great He is.

Prayer is a way of humbling yourself and is the opposite of
doing things by yourself. Receiving direction from God is the
greatest help you can get. If you fail to seek God's help, you
are headed for trouble, because the devil sets traps to destroy
you.

Also, talking with God forces you to honestly face your
situation -- for you know you cannot fool God.

To Benefit Others

All around us, people are in great need. Through prayer we can
appropriate heavenly help on their behalf.

God can do more in one minute than you can do in a lifetime.

SAY THIS: I will pray because prayer is beneficial.
