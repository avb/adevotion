Possess The Land

NUMBERS 33:53 NKJ
53 'you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell
in it, for I have given you the land to possess.

JOSHUA 1:3 NKJ
3 "Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I
have given you, as I said to Moses.

In Old Testament times the people of God received promises to
possess the physical land. They faced literal giants keeping
them from possessing what God said was theirs.

Today we face a similar challenge: overcome the obstacles and
possess the promised blessings given in the New Testament.

How can we possess and enjoy these promised blessings?

Faith!

HEBREWS 6:12 NKJ
12 that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who
through faith and patience inherit the promises.

What belongs to us? What has God said is ours to "possess"?

"All things!"

2 PETER 1:3 NKJ
3 as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain
to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called
us by glory and virtue,

ROMANS 8:32 NKJ
32 He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for
us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all
things?

1 CORINTHIANS 3:21 NKJ
21 Therefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours:

As New Testament believers our "giants" are demons and
unbelief. Every promise of blessing is ours to claim and
possess by faith.

SAY THIS: I will possess my "land" in Jesus' Name!
