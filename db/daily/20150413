Prayer Guidelines

Prayer is communication with God. Talking with Almighty God is
the greatest privilege you have.

God desires a growing relationship with you. Communication is
essential for a relationship to develop. Involve God in every
part of your life: every decision and every action. In that
sense you should pray without ceasing -- always being in
communication with God.

However, we need special prayer times focused completely on the
Lord. He is worthy of our time and attention -- and we require
this time with Him to develop spiritually.

Remember the instruction given in Psalm 100:4, "Enter into His
gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise." If
you seem to run out of words to praise God, use some of the
Psalms, or praise and give thanks in tongues (1 Corinthians
14:16-18).

Many use the model prayer our Lord gave in Matthew 6:9-13 as a
guideline for their special daily prayer time. Some of the
principles taught are:

*You are praying to your Father.
*First worship and honor God.
*Pray that God's will be done before praying about your own or
others' needs.
*Ask for God's forgiveness and help.
*Finish by praising God.

During times of prayer many find it helpful as a memory aid to
have a prayer list of people and things to pray for. Also,
keeping a journal of your prayer requests and answers is
beneficial and will bless you tremendously as the years go by.

Always base your prayer on Scripture. Scripture is God's
answer. Receiving from God in prayer involves taking His answer
(His Word) to Him and receiving your request by faith.

Also, every believer can and should develop the habit of
praying much in tongues. This not only edifies you spiritually
(1 Corinthians 14:4, Jude 1:20), but allows you to pray with a
wisdom beyond your ability and knowledge (Romans 8:26-27).

SAY THIS: Prayer is a privilege.
