We Shall Be Like Jesus

1 JOHN 3:2 NKJ
2 Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been
revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is
revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.

God's plan is to change you. He will not quit until you are
like Jesus Christ.

ROMANS 8:29 NKJ
29 For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to
the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many
brethren.

God has already made the decision. You WILL be like Jesus! (It
may take awhile -- but God has plenty of time.)

Surely this doesn't mean an identical physical appearance, but
perfection. Perfection morally, spiritually -- and yes, even
physically and mentally.

So don't be discouraged with where you are now. God is still at
work and He is no quitter.

PHILIPPIANS 1:6 NKJ
6 being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a
good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus
Christ;

How is God doing this? Primarily through His Word. So, stay in
the Word. The more you expose yourself to the accurate Word of
God, the more you will be changed into the likeness of Jesus
Christ.

SAY THIS: God is at work to make me like Jesus!
