You Are Part Of Christ's Body On Earth

1 CORINTHIANS 12 NLT
12 The human body has many parts, but the many parts make up
only one body. So it is with the body of Christ.
17 Suppose the whole body were an eye--then how would you hear?
Or if your whole body were just one big ear, how could you
smell anything?
18 But God made our bodies with many parts, and he has put each
part just where he wants it.
21 The eye can never say to the hand, "I don't need you." The
head can't say to the feet, "I don't need you."
22 In fact, some of the parts that seem weakest and least
important are really the most necessary.
27 Now all of you together are Christ's body, and each one of
you is a separate and necessary part of it.

Scripture says we are a Body -- not just that we are "like a 
body." You ARE connected to everyone who acknowledges Jesus 
Christ as Lord -- whether you like them, or think they are 
necessary, or not. Whatever happens to ANY member of the Body 
does have an affect on EVERY member.

Remember this the next time you are tempted to speak ill of 
another believer, or mistreat them. Even if they don't believe 
exactly like you, or go to the same church -- they are still 
connected to you in Christ. So be nice to your Body!

SAY THIS: I am a member of Christ's Body on earth. Today I will 
let Jesus Christ manifest His love and wisdom through me.
