The Holy Spirit Will Help You

JOHN 14:16 NKJ
16 "And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another
Helper, that He may abide with you forever,

If you allow Him to, the Holy Spirit will guide you in every
area of life; from the words you should speak, to the spouse
you should marry, to the investments you should make.

The Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity of God. It
is difficult for humans to understand how there can be only one
God, as the Scriptures teach, yet He can reveal Himself as
three persons. So do not let it be an obstacle for you, or be
drawn into fighting about it.

The Holy Spirit is a person, not just a force. He should be
treated with the utmost respect and gratitude.

I have personally found the Holy Spirit to be a wonderful,
wonderful Helper -- in so many ways. Even in simple, practical
things, like reminding me of things, or helping me to find
misplaced items. The Holy Spirit is truly interested in
everything that affects you, and desires to help you -- if you
will allow Him to.

No doubt, the Holy Spirit has been helping you, too. You just
may not have recognized it. You may have called it "a hunch" or
"it just came to me" or "I just had an idea." Start giving
thanks to the real source of your help -- the Holy Spirit of
God.

The Bible mentions several ways the Holy Spirit helps: teaching
you all things, bringing the Word to your remembrance, telling
you of things to come, revealing to you the things of God,
comforting you, encouraging you, empowering you to be a
witness, and bringing life and healing to you.

You are not facing life all alone -- as an orphan would. The
Holy Spirit is with you continually -- living with you. When
you need help He is never far away, but always right with you,
waiting for you to call on Him for His help.

SAY THIS: Holy Spirit, I appreciate your help. Thank you for
guiding me in life and helping me in every way.
