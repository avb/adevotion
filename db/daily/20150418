Cast Your Cares

1 PETER 5:7 AMPLIFIED
7 Casting the whole of your care -- all your anxieties, all
your worries, all your concerns, once and for all -- on Him;
for He cares for you affectionately, and cares about you
watchfully.

God is not just mildly interested in you. He cares for you just
as a good mother cares for her infant child -- affectionately
and watchfully.

Would it be reasonable for a well-loved infant to worry?
Neither is it reasonable for you to worry when God loves you
and has promised to take care of you.

To worry you must believe one of two lies: God can't take care
of you, or God won't take care of you.

PHILIPPIANS 4:6-7 NRSV
6 Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known
to God.
7 And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will
guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

Worry is not appropriate for a child of God.

SAY THIS: I throw all my cares on God because He cares for me.
