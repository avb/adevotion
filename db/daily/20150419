God's Word Will Make You Free

JOHN 8:31-32 NKJ
31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, "If you
abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed.
32 "And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you
free."

Many people are afraid that God's Word will put them in bondage
-- because of the rules they think they will have to follow.
But Jesus said God's Word would make you free.

Abide means to live, to continue, or to spend time somewhere.

If you continue to spend time in Jesus' Word -- you will know
the truth.

When you know the truth, you will act on that knowledge -- and
acting on the truth will make you free!

The Bible, especially the message of Jesus Christ in the New
Testament, will set you free if you continue in it.

We are not guaranteed instant results, although sometimes they
do happen. Freedom is certain, however, if you stick with God's
Word. Jesus gave His guarantee!

If you are not enjoying freedom in any area of your life -- you
have not continued in God's Word enough in that area. Feed it
in: speak it, sing it, read it, write it, think it, dream it!

God's Word has the information that, when acted upon, will make
you free!

SAY THIS: I will continue in God's Word and it will make me
free.
