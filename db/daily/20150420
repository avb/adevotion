Words Control Your Life

PROVERBS 18:20-21 NKJ
20 A man's stomach shall be satisfied from the fruit of his
mouth, and from the produce of his lips he shall be filled.
21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who
love it will eat its fruit.

Proverbs 18:20 says what your lips produce will fill your life.
Your lips produce -- words.

Words determine the course and the outcome of your life. You
now have, and will continue to have, the fruit your tongue
produces.

To change your life you need to change your words.

JAMES 3:2,8 NIV
2 We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in
what he says, he is a perfect man, able to keep his whole body
in check.
8 but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full
of deadly poison.

To change the words you speak you need God's help.

As Jesus said, out of the abundance of your heart your mouth
will speak. So, you need a new heart and you need it filled
with God's Word. Only in that way can your tongue be brought
under complete control.

SAY THIS: Lord, because your Word teaches that words control my
life, please help me to control my words.
