God Loves Sinners

JOHN 3:16 KJV
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
have everlasting life.

Many people quote John 3:16 -- but how many believe it?

God never changes. If He loved the people of the world in the
past -- He still loves them today. Yet many people think God is
mad at sinners -- and hates them.

ROMANS 5:8 NIV
8 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we
were still sinners, Christ died for us.

God is NOT mad at sinners. He loves them enough to die for them 
-- even today! We should not be mad at sinners either. They are 
deceived and enslaved by sin. They need to be delivered, and no 
one can do it except Jesus.

Of course, God doesn't want people to remain sinners. He loves
them too much for that. Sin destroys. It brings death. But the
gift of God is life -- and that gift is found in a Person: the
Lord Jesus Christ.

Jesus is the best friend a sinner will ever have. They need to
know that. Someone has to tell them the truth. They think Jesus
hates them because they're a sinner and not perfect. (The devil
already fed them that lie.)

Let's tell them the truth!

2 CORINTHIANS 5:19 NIV
19 that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not
counting men's sins against them. And he has committed to us
the message of reconciliation.

God is not holding people's sins against them. People need to
know that. When they do -- they will love Jesus.

SAY THIS: Jesus loves sinners -- so I love them, too. I love
them enough to tell them Jesus will help them.
