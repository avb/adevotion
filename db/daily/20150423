You Are Not An Orphan

JOHN 14:18 NIV
18 I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.

You are not facing life all alone -- no matter how you feel.

Jesus is with you. He promised to never forsake you.

Our enemy loves to make us think we have no help, that God does
not care, and we have no hope. But the devil is a liar.

"But why does God allow things to look so bleak? Why doesn't He
help me sooner?"

God desires faith and trust from us. Without testing times we
would have no opportunity to show our faith. Without obstacles
we would have nothing to overcome.

We must always remember that God is raising a family, preparing
us for eternity with Him.  It can be a great error to judge
everything by "the bottom line" today.

We must trust our Father God, because only He really knows what
the "true bottom line" is. And we can trust Him, because He is
good and trustworthy.

SAY THIS: Thank you Father God that I am not facing life all
alone -- as an orphan. You are my Father and are taking good
care of me. I trust You -- for time and eternity.
