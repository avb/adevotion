Instructions For Success

JOSHUA 1:8 NIV
8 Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth;
meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do
everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and
successful.

If you desire to succeed, here are the instructions.

You may follow other plans that promise success, but you have
no guarantee they will work long-term. People may give you
advice that works for awhile -- but can you be sure it will not
fail you someday?

With God you have an eternal guarantee: His Word will never
fail. Heaven and earth will disappear before even the smallest
detail of God's Word will fail.

Look at God's success instructions again. Study them in detail.
Surely if anything is worth your time, this promise of God is.

First, speak in line with God's Word. Isn't it interesting that
the first instruction from God for success has to do with what
you say? Some people proclaim that what you say doesn't matter,
but God puts it at the top of the list.

Second, meditate on what God said. This is the opposite of
worry. This is more than just reading the Bible. (Although if
you never read it, how could you meditate on it?) This is
thinking about what God says and how it affects everything.

When are we to think about God and His Word? When it is day, 
and when it is night. That does not leave any time when you 
should shut God out of your thoughts.

Look at what God promises will be yours if you follow these
instructions: prosperity and success. What everyone wants, but
few are willing to do what it takes to achieve.

Of course you can ignore these instructions. But why would you?

SAY THIS: I will speak God's Word, meditate on it, and act on
it. Then God promises I will be prosperous and successful.
