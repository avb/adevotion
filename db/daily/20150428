Faith Is Released Through Words

MATTHEW 17:20 NKJ
20 So Jesus said to them, "Because of your unbelief; for
assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed,
you will say to this mountain, `Move from here to there,' and
it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.

If you have faith -- you will do something -- according to
Jesus. You will speak!

Faith and authority are exercised through words. You must open
your mouth and speak in line with what God says.

All we receive from God must be received by faith. (See Romans
5:2 & Galatians 3:14.) So, you will only receive God's blessing
in line with the words you speak.

What you say is what you believe. Or, we could say, you believe
what you say.

If you want to know what someone truly believes, just listen to
what they say -- especially when they're under pressure. Then
the truth will come out.

MATTHEW 12:34-35 NKJ
34 "Brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good
things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
35 "A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings
forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure
brings forth evil things.

Your mouth speaks forth what is in your heart. So to bring
forth good things in your life, you need to speak good words.
To speak good words, they must first be put into your heart in
abundance. You know what that means. Get into the Bible and get
it into you.

SAY THIS: With faith, nothing is impossible. My faith is put
into action by the words I speak. The words I speak are
determined by what I put into my inner being.
