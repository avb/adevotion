The Message Of Reconciliation

2 CORINTHIANS 5:19 NIV
19 that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not
counting men's sins against them. And he has committed to us
the message of reconciliation.

The Good News is about reconciliation between God and man.
Jesus Christ accomplished it.

Mankind was estranged from God. We had gone our own way, were
lost, and couldn't find our way back to fellowship with God.
Fortunately, God loved us and did something to help us.

Two extremely important ideas are presented in the above verse.

First, God is not holding people's sins against them! As far as
God is concerned, Christ's sacrifice paid the penalty for all
sin -- and God considers the world reconciled back to Him.

Second, this wonderful good news of what God has done has been
committed to us. Human beings must tell it. If we don't -- it
won't be told.

People can live and die and never know the glorious truth that
God is not holding any sins against them  -- if no one tells
them. They need to know they are forgiven, loved by God, and
welcome to come back into fellowship with Him through Christ.

Think about this: God is interested in reconciliation. Not in
shutting you, or others, out. He is inviting humanity in,
saying all is forgiven.

SAY THIS: Thank You Father God for reconciling me and not
holding my sins against me. Please help me to share this
message with the right people in the right way.
