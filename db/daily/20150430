Jesus Is Your Righteousness

ROMANS 5:1 NLT
1 Therefore, since we have been made right in God's sight by
faith, we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our
Lord has done for us.

God offers righteousness as a free gift to everyone who
receives the Lord Jesus Christ.

Righteousness means right-wise-ness, or being right. So
righteousness is right standing, or good standing with God. It
does not mean human "perfection."

Righteousness is a gift from God -- not something you can earn
or achieve. God simply declares that you are innocent, as far
as He is concerned, because you believe in Jesus, and that
makes you righteous.

1 CORINTHIANS 1:30 NKJ
30 But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom
from God -- and righteousness and sanctification and redemption

You ARE righteous if Jesus is your Lord. In fact, Jesus IS your
righteousness. As a believer in Jesus, you will never be more
righteous -- no matter what you do.

Romans 3:10 is a well known verse on this subject that is often
misunderstood. It is a quote from the Old Testament, and is
part of a passage that continues on to say that NOW we can be
righteous through faith in Jesus Christ.

ROMANS 3:10 NKJ
10 As it is written: "There is none righteous, no, not one;

ROMANS 3:21-22 NKJ
21 But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is
revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,
22 even the righteousness of God which is through faith in
Jesus Christ to all and on all who believe. For there is no
difference;

Romans 10 gives instructions on how to become righteous.

ROMANS 10:9-10 NKJ
9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and
believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead,
you will be saved.
10 For with the heart one believes to righteousness, and with
the mouth confession is made to salvation.

SAY THIS: Jesus is my righteousness. I am in right standing
with God through what my Lord Jesus did for me.
