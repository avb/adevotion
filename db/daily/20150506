Every Good Gift Is From Above

JAMES 1:13,16,17 WEYMOUTH
13 Let no one say when passing through trial, "My temptation is
from God;" for God is incapable of being tempted to do evil,
and He Himself tempts no one.
16 Do not be deceived, my dearly-loved brethren.
17 Every gift which is good, and every perfect boon, is from
above, and comes down from the Father, who is the source of all
Light. In Him there is no variation nor the slightest
suggestion of change.

God is not doing evil that good may come from it.

"Do not be deceived," the Bible tells us in verse 16 above.
Obviously then, brethren CAN be deceived  -- and many ARE.

God is NOT the one behind the bad things happening. Deadly 
storms such as tornados and earthquakes are not acts of my God. 
Only good comes down from my Father God -- and He does not 
change or vary from day to day.

John 10:10 LB
10 The thief's purpose is to steal, kill and destroy. My
purpose is to give life in all its fullness.

John 10:10 is the dividing line in the Bible. The purpose of
the devil is made clear: to harm you. The purpose of the Lord
is also clear: life in all its fullness -- life as God intended.

Jesus is for you. The devil is against you. It's as simple as
that.

SAY THIS: The devil is against me, so I am against the devil.
God is for me, so I submit to God.
