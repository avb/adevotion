Jesus Is A Savior

MATTHEW 1:21 NIV
21 She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the
name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."

The name "Jesus" actually means "the Lord saves" or "the Lord
is a Savior."

So, when we say "Jesus" we are actually saying "Savior." The
two words are synonyms.

The angel told Joseph what to name the son born to his wife
Mary -- and the reason for that particular name. Jesus: because
He will save. We could say, "Savior -- because He will save."

Being a savior is integral to Jesus' nature. That's what He is.
Not just something that He does. He IS, by His very nature, a
Savior.

But we are so used to hearing the word "Savior" in relation to
Jesus that it has lost its meaning for us. It no longer affects
our thinking the way it should. So we need to hear another word
-- Deliverer.

The word savior means deliverer. To save something means to
deliver it. To deliver something means to set it free from what
held it down and kept it from being whole.

You don't have to convince Jesus to deliver you -- He IS a
deliverer! That's what He does. It's as natural for Him to set
you free and make you whole as it is for you to breathe.

All you have to do is allow Jesus jurisdiction in your life.
Invite Him in. He will bring deliverance.

Too many people have been deceived into thinking that allowing
Jesus into their life would put them in bondage and hold them
back. No! Jesus brings freedom. He delivers you from bondage.

SAY THIS: Jesus is my Deliverer! He delivers me from everything
that would hold me down and keep me from wholeness.
