Pray For Our Leaders

1 TIMOTHY 2:1-2 NASB
1 First of all, then, I urge that entreaties and prayers,
petitions and thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men,
2 for kings and all who are in authority, in order that we may
lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.

Praying for our leaders is not a useless ritual. God would not 
tell us to do something in His Word, unless it would make a 
difference.

Sometimes, when bad things happen, people ask why God allowed 
them to happen. But we should be asking ourselves why we 
allowed them to happen: by not obeying God and praying.

If believers are praying as we ought, we can expect many bad 
things and difficult times to be avoided.

Since God told us to pray for our leaders, it is our 
responsibility.

Of course, we shouldn't limit ourselves to praying only for our 
leaders. We should pray for all people. But we must not forget 
to pray for our leaders. And not just when we face difficult 
times, either. 

SAY THIS: Father, I pray that you would give our leaders 
wisdom, understanding, and insight into all the situations that 
we face, and the courage to do what is right.
