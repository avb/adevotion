God's Protection

God doesn't want us to live our lives in fear. Over and over
the Bible tells us to fear not.

Yet with all the terrible things happening in the world, how
can we not be afraid? How can we overcome the temptation to
fear?

We must know and remember that God loves us and has a good plan
for us: including a home in Heaven and going to be with Jesus
when we die. So we should not fear death as it is a promotion
and a gain for a Christian believer (Philippians 1:21).

Also, we must know and remember the promises of God given in
the Bible concerning protection from evil, accident, and harm
in this life. For example:

PSALM 91:9-11 NKJ
9 Because you have made the Lord, who is my refuge, Even the
Most High, your dwelling place,
10 No evil shall befall you, Nor shall any plague come near
your dwelling;
11 For He shall give His angels charge over you, To keep you in
all your ways.

This is not to say that victims of tragic events are sinners,
or are not loved by God. Only that if we walk with God and heed
His direction, God promises to protect us.

LUKE 10:19 NKJ
19 "Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and
scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing
shall by any means hurt you.

We know many good people have died unexpectedly. Yet the
promises of God stand true and should not be doubted. We don't
know what they knew or what they were believing. But we know
that God is faithful and keeps His promises.

There is a place of protection as you live close to God and
walk in faith. So do not be afraid!

SAY THIS: God gives His angels charge over me, to keep me safe
in all my ways.
