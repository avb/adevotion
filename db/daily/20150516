Put God First

MATTHEW 22:37-38 NKJ
37 Jesus said to him, "`You shall love the Lord your God with
all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.'
38 "This is the first and great commandment.

The most important command is to love God with all your being.
As with all His commands, God does not give this for His
benefit, but for your benefit. Putting God first will bless
you, improving your life and well-being.

Loving people, while important, is only secondary according to
Jesus. In practice -- because God loves people -- loving Him
will result in you loving people also.

When you get your priority backward -- putting people and their
needs first -- you miss God's plan, and will be relatively
ineffective in helping people -- compared to what you could
have been if you put God first.

MATTHEW 6:33 CEV
33 But more than anything else, put God's work first and do
what he wants. Then the other things will be yours as well.

Determine to follow Jesus and obey Him. Don't allow anything
other than Jesus Christ to be your highest priority.

SAY THIS: My highest priority is God. I will put God first in
my life.
