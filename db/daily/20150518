You Are Not A Failure

EPHESIANS 2:10 NIV
10 For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do
good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

You may have failed, but you are not a failure.

It is not the essence of what and who you are. Failure is just
something that happened to you.

God created you, and He made you able to do good. Maybe you
have not yet discovered what you were created for, but God has
a plan for you. When you fit into God's plan you will find that
God truly made you "a work of His art."

A donkey could compare itself to a race horse and think it was
a failure. But a donkey was created for other things than
running fast.

Find out what you were created to be and do. Then rejoice as
you do it.

SAY THIS: I am God's unique work of art -- still in progress.
