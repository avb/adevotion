God's Word Is Settled

PSALM 119:89 NKJ
89 Forever, O Lord, Your word is settled in heaven.

Heaven is not running around trying to figure out the will of
God. His Word is settled in Heaven.

God surely had enough time before the Bible was written down to
make any changes in His plans. Now that He has given His Word,
He will keep it and see that it comes to pass.

MARK 13:31 NKJ
31 "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no
means pass away."

ISAIAH 40:8 NKJ
8 "The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God
stands forever."

1 PETER 1:23 NKJ
23 having been born again, not of corruptible seed but
incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides
forever,

JOHN 17:17 NKJ
17 "Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth.

The issue is settled in Heaven. Now you should settle it: God's
Word is true. God said what He meant and meant what He said.

SAY THIS: God tells the truth, so I will not doubt what He has
said.
