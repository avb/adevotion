God Is Just

PSALM 89:14 NIV
14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne;
love and faithfulness go before you.

Every decent human being deeply detests injustice. When we see
it in life, or even in a movie, it agitates us. Nothing makes
our blood boil more than injustice.

We instinctively know injustice is wrong because God put that
within us when He made us in His image. You can be sure that
God's reign will never involve injustice of any kind.

PSALM 11:7 ICB
7 The Lord does what is right, and he loves justice. So honest
people will see his face.

While we may not understand all that God might do in judging
the human race, surely we can be confident with Abraham who
said in Genesis 18:25, "Will not the Judge of all the earth do
right?".

God is fair. God is just. God does what is right. God is
righteous. All these statements are equivalent.

People who would condemn God now are judging Him before the 
time -- before all the evidence is in -- before God has 
finished His great work with mankind. Then, and then only, 
shall we see and understand fully the greatness of the mercy 
and the justice of our wonderful God.

ISAIAH 9:7 NIV
7 Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no
end. He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom,
establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness
from that time on and forever. The zeal of the LORD Almighty
will accomplish this.

SAY THIS: God is fair and just, and He is the ultimate and only
judge that really matters.
