Jesus Is The Only Way

JOHN 14:6 NKJ
6 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No 
one comes to the Father except through Me.

The word translated "way" means road. Jesus is the road to God.

The Bible is clear. Jesus did not lie. There is no salvation or 
access into Heaven without receiving Jesus Christ.

ACTS 4:12 NIV
12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other
name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved."

The Bible clearly teaches there is only one name by which
people can be saved. That name is not Buddha, Confucius, or
Mohammed, but the Lord Jesus Christ.

There is no other way to God than through Jesus Christ.

SAY THIS: Jesus is the way for me to God.
