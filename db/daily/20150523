Destroyed For Lack Of Knowledge

Hosea 4:6 KJV
6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge . . . .

Are people's lives destroyed because God does not love them? Do
people come to ruin and live in misery because God is callous
and uncaring?

NO!

People are destroyed for lack of knowledge -- even God's
people. What kind of knowledge? Knowledge that is available in
the Bible: how to walk in faith, how to overcome, how to get
prayers answered, how to resist the devil, etc.

God is not to blame for our troubles. God has already made
provision for us. But we must avail ourselves of what God has
provided.

How can we benefit from God's great provision if we don't even
know about it? So, we should seek the knowledge of God on our
own, and receive teaching from others, also.

There is not one among us who does not have much to learn. No
one yet is walking in the absolute fullness of what God has
provided.

This must be one of the saddest verses in the Bible. To think
that God's people are destroyed simply because of a lack of
knowledge. As God's children, they are our brothers and
sisters. It is our relatives being destroyed, and we should do
what we can to stop it.

Let's quit giving place to the devil by our lack of knowledge 
of God's Word. And, as we learn from God's Word we should share 
our knowledge with others, so they can walk in freedom and 
victory, too.

SAY THIS: I will study God's Word so I can know the truth and
not let the devil destroy me for lack of knowledge.
