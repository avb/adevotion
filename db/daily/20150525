God's Word In Your Mouth

EPHESIANS 6:17 NIV
17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit,
which is the word of God.

The sword, or weapon, of the spirit is speaking the Word of
God. Left sitting in a book on your shelf, it does you no good.

A weapon must be used against an adversary to be of any 
benefit. Our adversary is the devil and a weapon he uses is 
doubt. We must speak God's Word to actively resist doubt, so it 
won't defeat us.

JAMES 1:22 NIV
22 Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves.
Do what it says.

We need to personalize the Bible, and act on it. The first, and
main, way to accomplish this is to speak in agreement with what
the Bible says.

SAY THIS: I take the sword of the spirit and put it in my mouth
by speaking in agreement with the Word of God.
