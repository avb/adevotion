Actively Receive

In the Greek New Testament there are several words we translate
into English using the word "receive." "Lambano" is the Greek
word we could translate as "actively receive."

It is important for you to understand this word. Many expect
things promised in the Bible to just fall on them. But, as you
will see from understanding this word, "lambano," you have a
part to play in receiving the Bible promises.

You can passively receive something. An example would be
someone throwing a ball through your window into your home.
That kind of receiving requires no action on your part.

"Lambano" is not like that. It requires that you do something.
Like when you reach out your hands and grab a ball someone
threw to you.

For example, the following scriptures contain the Greek word, 
"lambano." This may help you get a better understanding of what 
receive means when it translates this word, lambano.

MARK 12:8 NKJ
8 "And they TOOK him and killed him and cast him out of the
vineyard.

JOHN 19:6 NKJ
6 ...Pilate said to them, "You TAKE Him and crucify Him, for I 
find no fault in Him."

As the above passages show, sometimes lambano is translated as 
take or took -- and is not at all passive, but very active.

JOHN 1:12 NKJ
12 But as many as RECEIVED Him, to them He gave the right to
become children of God, even to those who believe in His name:

Receiving Jesus and becoming a child of God is not something
that happens by accident. Each person has to make the choice to
actively choose Jesus.

MATTHEW 21:22 NKJ
22 "And all things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you
will RECEIVE."

ROMANS 5:17 NKJ
17 For if by the one man's offense death reigned through the
one, much more those who RECEIVE abundance of grace and of the
gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus
Christ.)

Remember that receiving is something you must actively do.

SAY THIS: I will be an active receiver of all God has for me.
