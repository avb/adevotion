Be Quick To Listen

JAMES 1:19 NLT
19 My dear brothers and sisters, be quick to listen, slow to
speak, and slow to get angry.

You learn by listening -- not by talking.

The biggest barrier to learning is thinking you already know a
subject. If you think you already know everything, it is
difficult to learn anything more.

You can learn from every person -- if you will just listen to
what they have to say. Everyone knows something you do not
know.

Pride robs you from learning from others. Pride keeps you
ignorant -- while making you think you are wise.

ROMANS 1:22 NLT
22 Claiming to be wise, they became utter fools instead.

This is not to say you should accept everything you hear as
truth -- just that you should be humble enough, and respect
people enough, to listen and evaluate what they have to say.

Listen and learn. Talk too much and only embarrass yourself.

PROVERBS 17:27-28 ICB
27 The person who has knowledge says very little. And a person
with understanding stays calm.
28 Even a foolish person seems to be wise if he keeps quiet. He
appears to have understanding if he doesn't speak.

Proud people act as if they have a duty to display their
superior knowledge to all who will listen. They are quick to
speak, because they "know" they are right.

PROVERBS 10:19 ICB
19 If you talk a lot, you are sure to sin. If you are wise, you
will keep quiet.

It is not wrong to talk -- just don't talk too much. And don't
be so anxious to impress people with what you know.

ECCLESIASTES 5:3 NLT
3 Just as being too busy gives you nightmares, being a fool
makes you a blabbermouth.

SAY THIS: I will be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to
become angry.
