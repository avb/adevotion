Don't Give Up!

1 CORINTHIANS 10:13 THE MESSAGE
13 No test or temptation that comes your way is beyond the
course of what others have had to face. All you need to
remember is that God will never let you down; he'll never let
you be pushed past your limit; he'll always be there to help
you come through it.

All of us have been tempted to lose hope and give up. But we
always have a choice: focus on God and stay in faith, or focus
on the problem and give up.

Problems -- no matter how huge they seem to us -- are no
problem to God. Nothing is too hard, or complicated, for God to
solve. But God wants us to trust Him.

So what should you do when you are being tempted and feel like
giving in and giving up?

Refuse!

Just keep your focus on the Lord and rejoice in His
faithfulness. Remember that God cannot lie, and will never
fail. God will see you through.

HEBREWS 10:23 NKJ
23 Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without
wavering, for He who promised is faithful.

When the devil tries to steal your faith, he tries to get you
to quit speaking in agreement with the Word of God. Don't let
it happen! Hold fast to speaking your faith! Keep on saying
what the Word of God says about you and your situation. Don't
be moved by the circumstances.

GALATIANS 6:9 NIV
9 Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time
we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.

Don't grow weary. Keep your eyes on the Lord. His Word will
work and produce a harvest of blessing in your life. Don't
doubt it!

SAY THIS: I will keep trusting in God and never give up!
