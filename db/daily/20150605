God Cares

1 PETER 5:7 AMPLIFIED
7 Casting the whole of your care -- all your anxieties, all
your worries, all your concerns, once and for all -- on Him;
for He cares for you affectionately, and cares about you
watchfully.

EXODUS 3:7 NIV
7 The LORD said, "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in
Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave
drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.

ISAIAH 63:9 NIV
9 In all their distress he too was distressed, and the angel of
his presence saved them. In his love and mercy he redeemed
them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.

JOHN 11:35 KJV
35 Jesus wept.

Of course, the question arises, "If God cares, why doesn't He
do something?"

The answer is that God has already done something. Now it is
our turn to act. God has redeemed mankind and set us free from
the dominion of darkness by the sacrifice of Calvary. Now we
must believe God's Word and act on it.

The truth, which you may find hard to accept, is that God is
already doing all He can to help you. But often, we are
blocking God's help in our lives by our unbelief and acting
contrary to the instructions of God's Word.

The solution is to ask God to help us see the truth and act on
it. We should ask God to show us how we can stop hindering Him
from blessing us as He desires.

SAY THIS: God cares about me and everything that concerns me.
