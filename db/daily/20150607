Act On God's Word

JAMES 1:22 NKJ
22 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving
yourselves.

How easily we fall into the trap of listening to, or even
studying, the Bible -- but not acting on its instructions.
According to this verse, that opens us up to deception. We
think we are spiritual. We think we are safe. But then, when
things don't work out we will blame God and question why He let
us down.

LUKE 6:46-49 NKJ
46 "But why do you call Me `Lord, Lord,' and do not do the
things which I say?
47 "Whoever comes to Me, and hears My sayings and does them, I
will show you whom he is like:
48 "He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid
the foundation on the rock. And when the flood arose, the
stream beat vehemently against that house, and could not shake
it, for it was founded on the rock.
49 "But he who heard and did nothing is like a man who built a
house on the earth without a foundation, against which the
stream beat vehemently; and immediately it fell. And the ruin
of that house was great."

Trouble is coming -- it's part of this life. If you act on the 
Word, trouble will not destroy you and your household. If you 
neglect acting on the Word -- no matter how much you hear it -- 
when trouble comes your way, it may be devastating.

Why?

Not because it's God's will, or God doesn't love you. Simply
because you refused to act on the instructions which God -- who
knows more than you do -- gave you for your protection.

DEUTERONOMY 12:28 NKJ
28 "Observe and obey all these words which I command you, that
it may go well with you and your children after you forever,
when you do what is good and right in the sight of the Lord
your God.

God gave us His Word because He loves us and desires to help
us. Not because He likes to boss people around and give orders.
Acting on God's Word is for our benefit.

SAY THIS: I will act on what God says to me in His Word.
