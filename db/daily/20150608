Your Body Is Your House

2 CORINTHIANS 5:1 NKJ
1 For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is
destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with
hands, eternal in the heavens.

The "real you" is not your body. Your body is just a house you
live in so you can function here on earth.

Just as someone can change houses where they live, you can, and
will someday, leave your body and still exist.

We focus too much on our body. The inner part of us is most
important. These bodies we live in are not eternal.

It is not wrong to take care of our bodies, any more than it is
wrong to take care of the house or apartment where we live. It
is a mistake, however, to spend all our time on our body and
neglect our spirit and mind.

1 TIMOTHY 4:8 RSV
8 for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of
value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life
and also for the life to come.

Who a person is on the inside is more important than what their
body looks like.

We judge too often on the house (body) that people live in,
instead of focusing on the real person living inside that body.

SAY THIS: My body is only a temporary house where I live.
