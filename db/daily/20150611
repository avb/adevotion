God Feeds The Birds

MATTHEW 6:26 LB
26 Look at the birds! They don't worry about what to eat -- they
don't need to sow or reap or store up food -- for your heavenly
Father feeds them. And you are far more valuable to him than
they are.

Have you ever watched birds eating on a snowy day? It takes
some effort on their part. They don't just sit around waiting
for someone to put food in their mouth.

Is God feeding them? Directly or indirectly?

Jesus stated clearly that God is the one who provides food for
the birds. This implies that God provides for every creature.

Yet, if a bird sits still, instead of gathering the food God
has provided for them, they will starve.

Birds must have faith that food is available somewhere, so they
keep searching. They don't sit in the spot where they found
food yesterday and wait for more food to show up there today.
They keep looking, obviously confident that food is available
somewhere.

Yes, the birds can be a good lesson for us. Although they have
nothing stored up for their future, they don't worry. Neither
should we. They gather daily what God provides for them. So
should we. (This is not to say it is wrong to save or invest
for your future, but only that you should trust God either
way.)

I don't know whether the birds are thankful to God, or not. But
we should be thankful. And we should recognize that God is the
Source of all the good that we enjoy in life.

So work, but don't worry. (And if you can't do normal work --
still don't worry, because God cares more for you than He does
the birds, and He will provide for you somehow.)

And when you have a need, keep searching for the provision
while keeping your focus on God, because you know that God
always provides for you.

SAY THIS: God cares for the birds, so I know He will take care
of me.
