Keep Thanking God

1 THESSALONIANS 5:18 CEV
18 Whatever happens, keep thanking God because of Jesus Christ.
This is what God wants you to do.

There are many things in life we may not understand. But we
can understand this verse, and know that God gave these
instructions for our benefit, to help us -- not because God is
so insecure that He needs constant thanks.

When bad things happen, what should we do?

Will it help to gripe and complain and feel sorry for
ourselves?

No. That only makes things worse.

When bad things happen they seem to contradict belief in the
goodness and care of God.

But we must remember that there is an enemy, the devil, who is
out to steal our faith, our peace, and our joy. We are
commanded in Scripture to resist him, staying strong in our
faith.

Giving thanks is a powerful way to resist the devil. Even when
we do not understand, and it seems like things are out of
control and going downhill fast -- we should force ourselves to
stay in faith and be thankful.

(I am not saying God is responsible for evil, or to thank God
for evil. Instead, I am saying we can thank God for what He is
doing, and what He has already done for us in the sacrifice of
Jesus -- no matter what may be happening.)

1 THESSALONIANS 5:18 NLT
18 No matter what happens, always be thankful, for this is
God's will for you who belong to Christ Jesus.

SAY THIS: I will keep thanking God, no matter what happens.
