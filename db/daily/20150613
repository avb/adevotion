Prayer Is An Exchange

ISAIAH 40:31 NKJ
31 But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; 
They shall mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run and 
not be weary, They shall walk and not faint. 

Time is precious. Our lives are full. Life is busy. Many of us 
think we are too busy to spend time in regular daily prayer. 
But is that a wise choice?

In the Scripture passage above, the literal meaning is "those 
who look to the Lord expectantly will exchange strength."

Prayer is an exchange of strength.

God offers to exchange what He has for what we have. As we 
spend time looking to Him, this exchange takes place.

What strength does God have? Wisdom. Understanding. Insight. 
Guidance. Favor. Influence. Health. Everything we need!

When you give your time to God, He reciprocates by giving His 
time to you. He goes ahead of you and makes your way smooth, 
giving you favor and guidance so you can walk in victory.

God will give you ideas as you wait on Him. Ideas of how to do 
things better. (For example, I got this message while praying.)

You may think you don't have anything God would want. But God 
wants your love and your trust. As a human, you also have God-
delegated authority on Earth, especially as a member of the 
Body of Christ.

Exchanging the little strength you have for the strengths of 
God is a great trade!

Don't miss this wonderful benefit!

SAY THIS: I will invest time looking to the Lord expectantly in 
prayer.
