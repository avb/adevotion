The Ministry Of God

EPHESIANS 4:12 NIV
12 to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the
body of Christ may be built up

Ministry means service. To minister is to serve.

How does God "serve us"?

God serves us by helping us. So, primarily, ministry means
helping people. Of course, the foremost way of helping people
is to help them know God and His Word, so they can receive all
God has provided for them.

But anything that helps people -- that makes their life easier,
or better -- is also ministry. That is, it is part of the
ministry of God: God's purpose, God's plan, God's desire for
humanity.

God desires the best for all people. People were God's idea,
and He longs to bless them.

God helps people. So, when you help someone, even in the
smallest way, you are acting like God.

EPHESIANS 5:1-2 NASB
1 Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children;
2 and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you, and gave
Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a
fragrant aroma.

We are to imitate our Father God -- or act like Him. How? By
walking in love, just as Christ did.

In practical terms, what is walking in love? Helping people.
Walking in love means you will help people, you will put their
interests first.

When you help people, you are involved in the ministry of God.

SAY THIS: When I help people, I am serving God.
