Watch Your Words

PROVERBS 6:2 NKJ
2 You are snared by the words of your mouth; You are taken by
the words of your mouth.

MARK 11:23 NKJ
23 "For assuredly, I say to you . . . he will have whatever he
says.

Words are powerful. They are the way humans express their
decisions. Words carry authority, even in the spiritual realm.

God created the world with spoken words. Humans are created in
the image and likeness of God. Therefore our words also carry
authority.

The words you speak are important and carry more weight than
you may realize.

Words can get you into trouble. And words can deliver you.

The most powerful and life-giving words in the universe are
those spoken by God the Creator.

Fortunately for us, some of what God has said has been written
down, for our benefit, in the Bible.

So, we can, and should speak words that are in agreement with
what God says. When we do, the power of God is released,
because it is God's Word we are speaking.

Remember: whatever God says never loses its power.

SAY THIS: Please help me Lord to watch my words and speak in
agreement with Your Word.
