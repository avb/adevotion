God's Word Will Build You Up

ACTS 20:32 NLT
32 "And now I entrust you to God and the word of his grace--his
message that is able to build you up and give you an
inheritance with all those he has set apart for himself.

Many shy away from the Bible because they think it's just a
bunch of rules to keep them from enjoying life.

Although many have misused the Bible -- to tear people down,
its true purpose is to build people up.

Tradition makes us think a good sermon should "skin 'em alive"
and make the listeners feel guilty.

But God is on your side and He loves you. So He gave you His
Word for your benefit, to build you up and give you things --
not to take anything good away from you.

Certainly God's Word can, and will, correct you. But primarily,
if you understand it correctly, the Word will build you up --
not beat you down and make you feel guilty.

Yes, there are passages in the Bible that will not encourage
you. They are needful at certain times for certain people who
need to be corrected and called to repentance. But for those
who love God and are His children, there are words of
encouragement to build you up.

Feed on the Word of God's grace -- His favor, His love, His
goodness. It will build you up.

If what you are feeding on is not encouraging your faith, check
to see if it really lines up with the Word.

Don't spend all your time meditating on a passage from the 
Bible that's not written to you. All the Bible is profitable, 
and we can learn from it. But you should concentrate on what 
God is saying to you, as His child: a member of the Body of 
Christ.

The message God has for His family, the church, is primarily
found in the letters (epistles) in the New Testament. These are
written directly to us, the church.

God is never interested in just cutting you down, or hurting you.
His intention is to build you up, to encourage you, to make you
better.

SAY THIS: The true message of the New Testament will build me
up. It is good news.
