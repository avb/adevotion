Respect People

JAMES 3:9-10 NIV
9 With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we
curse men, who have been made in God's likeness.
10 Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers,
this should not be.

It seems that respect has gone out of style. But God's
unchanging Word teaches us to treat people with respect.

Not agreeing with someone is no reason to treat them
disrespectfully. Just because they are wrong does not make them
unworthy of respect.

By His death for them, Jesus showed us He considers people
valuable and precious. So, we should not treat people as
insignificant or worthless.

Disrespecting people is actually disrespecting God who created
them.

God considers this so vital for wives, He gave a specific
command to respect their husband.

EPHESIANS 5:33 NIV
33 However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves
himself, and the wife must respect her husband.

Certainly, we should respect all people, but Scripture gives 
special emphasis to wives respecting their husbands. God did 
not say this to put women in bondage, but to help them.

A wise woman will enjoy the benefits, both now and for
eternity, of acting on this command from a loving Heavenly
Father.

MATTHEW 25:40 NIV
40 "The King will reply, `I tell you the truth, whatever you
did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for
me.'

The world respects people who are rich, famous, and successful.
Anyone can do that.

But how do you treat those who are thought to be the "least,"
who seemingly cannot help you in any way?

SAY THIS: I will respect people because they are valuable to
God and He loves them.
