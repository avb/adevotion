Motives

PROVERBS 16:2 NLT
2 People may be pure in their own eyes, but the LORD examines
their motives.

Motives are important to God.

God is interested in WHY we do things, not just in WHAT we do.

Why do you do what you do?

Is it to help others? To please God? Or do you live focused
totally on yourself?

These questions are important to ask ourselves. As First
Corinthians 11:31 says, "if we would judge ourselves, we should
not be judged."

However, we must use caution when trying to judge other people.
We don't know their motives.

PROVERBS 21:2 LB
2 We can justify our every deed, but God looks at our motives.

We often justify ourselves, but judge others harshly. We may
judge ourselves based on our good intentions, but we are only
capable of judging others by their actions.

So, we must be very cautious about judging others in a
condemning way.

1 CORINTHIANS 4:5 NIV
5 Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait till
the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in
darkness and will expose the motives of men's hearts. At that
time each will receive his praise from God.

One main reason we are not qualified to judge others is because
we don't know their thoughts, intentions, and motives. Only God
does.

SAY THIS: Lord, please help me to be aware of my motives.
