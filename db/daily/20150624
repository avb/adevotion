Pride and Humility

PROVERBS 22:4 NKJ
4 By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and
life.

Humility is the opposite of pride.

Humility does not think it is better than anyone else. "I am
what I am by the grace of God."

1 PETER 5:5 NKJ
5 Likewise you younger people, submit yourselves to your
elders. Yes, all of you be submissive to one another, and be
clothed with humility, for "God resists the proud, but gives
grace to the humble."

A humble person is one who follows God's instructions, instead
of leaning to their own understanding.

Being a humble person does not mean being a loser. A humble
person is one who has the proper relationship to God and grasps
reality, which is: without God, we can do nothing.

Humility will cause a person to remember their need to pray.

A humble person is one who prefers to suffer wrong rather than
do wrong.

Pride will bring you low. Humility will cause God to exalt you.

LUKE 14:11 NKJ
11 "For whoever exalts himself will be abased, and he who
humbles himself will be exalted."

God cannot exalt proud people without it harming them.

JAMES 4:10 NKJ
10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift
you up.

1 PETER 5:6 NKJ
6 Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God,
that He may exalt you in due time,

SAY THIS: Lord, please help me to beware of pride.
