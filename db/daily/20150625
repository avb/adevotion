Believing Prayer Changes Things

We have authority in our domain and can choose to invite God's 
involvement -- or not.

EZEKIEL 22:30 NKJ
30 "So I sought for a man among them who would make a wall, and 
stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land, that I should 
not destroy it; but I found no one.

JOHN 16:23-24 NKJ
23 ". . . Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the 
Father in My name He will give you.
24 "Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you 
will receive, that your joy may be full.

JOHN 14:13-14 NKJ
13 "And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the 
Father may be glorified in the Son.
14 "If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.

Christ has delegated a certain amount of His authority in the 
earth to His Body, the church. Our decisions as believers -- 
which we can express in prayer -- make a difference in our 
lives and others' lives.

MARK 11:24 NKJ
24 ". . . whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that 
you receive them, and you will have them.

JEREMIAH 33:3 NKJ
3 `Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and 
mighty things, which you do not know.'

PSALM 50:15 NKJ
15 Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and 
you shall glorify Me."

SAY THIS: God invites me to pray and believe, so His will can 
be done on earth as it is in heaven.
