Jesus Prayed

LUKE 5:16 NKJ
16 So He Himself often withdrew into the wilderness and prayed.

But why?

Jesus prayed and He is our example. If prayer was necessary for
Jesus -- how much more so for us.

JOHN 13:15 NKJ
15 "For I have given you an example. . . .

LUKE 6:12 NKJ
12 . . . He went out to the mountain to pray, and continued all
night in prayer to God.

MARK 1:35 NKJ
35 . . . a long while before daylight, He went out and departed
to a solitary place; and there He prayed.

Jesus obviously impressed His disciples with His prayer life,
and the importance of prayer. They asked Him to teach them to
pray -- the only thing recorded that they ever asked Jesus to
teach them.

LUKE 11:1 NKJ
1 And it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place,
when He ceased, that one of His disciples said to Him, "Lord,
teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples."

SAY THIS: Jesus knows more than I do, so I will follow His
example and spend time in prayer with my Father God.
