Lack Of Knowledge

HOSEA 4:6a NKJ
6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.

People wonder why many Christians experience so much trouble in 
life, instead of victory. The reason, according to the Bible, 
is a lack of knowledge.

The Bible tells us the devil is out to destroy us, but it also
makes clear that we can overcome his attacks. The real problem
lies with our ignorance of God's Word.

Real knowledge produces faith. When we really know something,
we have faith in it. Then we will act on that knowledge.

The reason God's people are destroyed by calamity is not 
because God doesn't love us, or because God is not able to help 
us. It is simply that we don't know the truth. If we really 
knew the truth, we would act on that knowledge. Acting on true 
knowledge makes you free -- it does not destroy you or put you 
into bondage.

JOHN 8:31-32 NKJ
31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, "If you
abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed.
32 "And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you
free."

God's Word is our instruction book. When we act on it, things
will work for us. God allows us to make choices. When we make
the right choices, we will be blessed.

Don't let the devil condemn you with this message. Instead, let
it give you hope. You can learn God's Word and act on it more
accurately in the future -- and be blessed!

SAY THIS: God gave me the knowledge in the Bible so I could
know the truth, act on it, and be blessed.
