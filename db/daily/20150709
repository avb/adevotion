None Of These Things Move Me

ACTS 20:24 NKJ
24 "But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life
dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the
ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to
the gospel of the grace of God.

Some believers are tempted to give up on their faith in God
whenever the least thing seems to go wrong in their lives.

The apostle Paul suffered many things: beatings, stoning, and
shipwreck -- yet he called them "light afflictions."

2 CORINTHIANS 4:17 NKJ
17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is
working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory,

2 CORINTHIANS 4:8-9 NKJ
8 We are hard pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are
perplexed, but not in despair;
9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed --

We are in a battle for the hearts and souls of men. The devil
is against us. While we know our victory is sure, we should not
expect to never face obstacles or difficulties.

2 TIMOTHY 2:3 NKJ
3 You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus
Christ.

If this life was all there was, this would not be a wise way to
live. But there is a life in heaven and a future world. We
would be foolish to live as if this life is all there is.

So we should not forget eternity and focus only on the present.

We must hold on to our faith in God, no matter how things seem
to be going at the present. Because of our limited
understanding, our ability to evaluate things accurately is
limited. Our wonderful Lord Jesus can be trusted. He loved us
enough to die in our stead, so we could go free. Why would He
lie to us?

We must be determined not to be moved by things our enemy does
to get us off our faith in God's Word.

SAY THIS: I'm not moved by what I see. I'm not moved by what I
feel. I'm moved only by what I believe, and I believe the Word
of God.
