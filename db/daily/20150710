Expect Favor

PSALM 5:12 NIV
12 For surely, O LORD, you bless the righteous; you surround
them with your favor as with a shield.

If Jesus is your Lord, then He is also your righteousness (1
Corinthians 1:30, Romans 5:17). So, you are righteous in Christ
and qualify for this blessing.

Favor is the blessing of God causing people to like you and
treat you well.

Why expect favor?

Because God is your Father. He loves you. And He responds to
faith. When you walk in faith you expect blessings.

PROVERBS 16:7 NIV
7 When a man's ways are pleasing to the LORD, he makes even his
enemies live at peace with him.

Some people always talk of how badly they are treated and how
things always go wrong for them. Should we be surprised? After
all, Jesus told us in Mark 11:23 that we would have what we
say.

Why not begin to say that God surrounds your life with favor?

SAY THIS: I expect God's favor in my life.
