Do Not Worry

PHILIPPIANS 4:6 NLT
6 Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything.
Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done.

Worrying can't accomplish anything. So why do it?

MATTHEW 6:25-34 NKJ
25 "Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life,
what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your
body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and
the body more than clothing?
26 "Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor
reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds
them. Are you not of more value than they?
27 "Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his
stature?
28 "So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies
of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin;
29 "and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory
was not arrayed like one of these.
30 "Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which
today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not
much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
31 "Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or
'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
32 "For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your
heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
33 "But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,
and all these things shall be added to you.
34 "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will
worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own
trouble.

LUKE 10:41-42 NKJ
41 And Jesus answered and said to her, "Martha, Martha, you
are worried and troubled about many things.
42 "But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good
part, which will not be taken away from her."

What did Mary choose that was better than worrying? Spending
time with Jesus hearing His Word. You would do well to follow
her example.

SAY THIS: I will trust in God and not worry.
