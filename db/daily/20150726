Abraham's Blessings Are Yours

GALATIANS 3:13-14 KJV
13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being
made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one
that hangeth on a tree:
14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the
Spirit through faith.

Galatians tells us Christ redeemed us, so that the blessing of
Abraham might come upon us.

What were the blessings Abraham enjoyed?

GENESIS 24:1 NIV
1 Abraham was now old and well advanced in years, and the LORD
had blessed him in every way.

GENESIS 13:2 KJV
2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

Abraham's blessing also extended to his descendants as they
walked with God.

GENESIS 25:11 KJV
11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God
blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

GENESIS 26:12-13 NIV
12 Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a
hundredfold, because the LORD blessed him.
13 The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until
he became very wealthy.

According to Romans, Abraham was promised the world for his
descendants, and we who have faith in Christ Jesus are those
descendants.

ROMANS 4:13 KJV
13 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world,
was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but
through the righteousness of faith.

It should not be hard to believe that Jesus Christ is heir of
this entire world. And remember that Romans 8:17 says we are
joint heirs with Christ.

GALATIANS 3:9 KJV
9 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful
Abraham.

Abraham's blessings do not come on everyone -- only people of
faith. Abraham was blessed because of his faith in God's Word.
We must receive these blessings by faith, also. So, if we
refuse to believe they are for us, we will not have them.

SAY THIS: In Christ Jesus, all the blessings Abraham enjoyed
are mine.
