Doing Good

ACTS 10:38 NKJ
38 "how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and
with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were
oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.

In this summary of the earthly life of Jesus Christ, the first
thing mentioned is that He "went about doing good."

What does the Bible mean when it speaks of "doing good?"

Doing good must involve some type of giving: either of time or
resources. How else can anyone do good?

Look at some of the verses that instruct us to "do good."

MATTHEW 5:44 NKJ
44 "But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse
you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who
spitefully use you and persecute you,

LUKE 6:27,33,35 NKJ
27 "But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to
those who hate you,
33 "And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit
is that to you? For even sinners do the same.
35 "But love your enemies, do good, and lend, hoping for
nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will
be sons of the Most High. For He is kind to the unthankful and
evil.

GALATIANS 6:10 NKJ
10 Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all,
especially to those who are of the household of faith.

HEBREWS 13:16 NKJ
16 But do not forget to do good and to share, for with such
sacrifices God is well pleased.

SAY THIS: Like my Lord Jesus, I will go about doing good.
