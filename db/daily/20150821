God Will Save Your Family

ACTS 16:31 NKJ
31 So they said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you
will be saved, you and your household."

We have a right to believe for the salvation of all our family
members. God's desire is for everyone to know Him and enjoy
life with Him.

2 PETER 3:9 NKJ
9 The Lord is . . . not willing that any should perish but that
all should come to repentance.

God never forces anyone to accept Him and love Him. But when we 
pray for people, God releases His forces and strongly 
influences them with His truth. When people are confronted with 
the reality of God, they will accept Him. Spiritual blindness 
is the only reason anyone rejects Jesus Christ.

Praying for those we love gives God a valid invitation to work
in their lives, so they can know the truth.

We should also use the authority of Jesus' Name to break the
devil's blindness over our loved ones.

2 CORINTHIANS 4:3-4 NKJ
3 But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who
are perishing,
4 whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not
believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ,
who is the image of God, should shine on them.

There is a spiritual reason why people have not accepted the
Lord Jesus Christ. We must deal with the root of the problem,
not just the outward circumstances. We can command the devil to
release them and stop blinding them to the truth.

When we pray for others it may not seem like anything is
happening outwardly, but behind the scenes we can be certain
that God is working. We should continue in faith and resist any
thoughts of doubt.
