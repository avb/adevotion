Spiritual Growth

2 PETER 3:18 NKJ
18 but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and forever. Amen.

We can gain understanding of spiritual growth by comparing it
to natural growth. There are many similarities.

We do not start out as full-grown adults. It takes time,
nurture, and experience to learn and develop.

In the natural realm, physical food is required. In the
spiritual realm the food required for strength and growth is
the Word of God.

MATTHEW 4:4 NKJ
4 But He answered and said, "It is written, 'Man shall not live
by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth
of God.'"

Spiritual growth is part of the Christian life. God's Word is
our spiritual food. Not only do we need to read it, but also to
speak it and meditate on it.

EPHESIANS 4:15 NKJ
15 but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things
into Him who is the head -- Christ --

A new-born Christian has the same authority over the devil and
all his forces as any of the Apostles. They also have the same
righteousness -- which is a gift from God. In the natural a
new-born baby has all the same muscles as a professional
athlete, but they cannot accomplish the same things because
they are not as developed. Yet they have the same potential,
which over time can be developed.

1 PETER 2:2 NKJ
2 as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you
may grow thereby,

So keep feeding your spirit on the Word of God and act on what
you learn. Just like a natural child, you will fall down a few
times while learning how to walk. But you must get up and try
again. God will watch over you and protect you as any good
parent should, so you don't have to be afraid.

SAY THIS: God's plan is for me to grow spiritually.
