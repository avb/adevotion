What Is The Kingdom Of God?

ROMANS 14:17 ESV
17 For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and
drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy
Spirit.

A kingdom is the domain of a king. It is wherever a king
governs, or is in control. A king can be in control without
being physically present. Wherever his ideas and rules are
governing is part of his domain, or kingdom.

This is the point of Romans 14:17. God's kingdom is not just a
location where you would live (eat and drink), but it is
everywhere we allow God and His spirit to govern us.

So the Kingdom of God includes everywhere the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ is acknowledged as King. It is where His
ideas govern and where His rules are obeyed.

1 JOHN 4:8 ESV
8 Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is
love.

God is love, so the Kingdom of God is the Kingdom of Love.
There can be no selfishness in the Kingdom of Love.

In the Kingdom of Love, everyone delights to help others. Not
by force, for it will be our joy to do everything we can to
benefit everyone else. (Therefore it will be Heaven!) Every
inhabitant will have the same nature as Jesus Christ, a nature
of selfless love for others.

LUKE 17:20-21 NLT
20 One day the Pharisees asked Jesus, "When will the Kingdom of
God come?" Jesus replied, "The Kingdom of God can't be detected
by visible signs.
21 You won't be able to say, 'Here it is!' or 'It's over
there!' For the Kingdom of God is already among you."

So the Kingdom of God is not restricted to a certain place or
time, like Spain or the USA -- or even Heaven. The Kingdom of
God is everywhere that God is accepted and acknowledged. The
Kingdom of God is everywhere the nature and ideas of God
govern.

The Kingdom of God means the rule of God, where God's Word (His
ideas) are followed. Not acting on God's Word is stepping into
the kingdom of darkness.

SAY THIS: I am part of the Kingdom of God, Who is Love.
