Rejoice In The Lord

PHILIPPIANS 4:4 NKJ
4 Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice!

At least five times the Bible tells the people of God to
rejoice in the Lord.

We may not always be able to rejoice in other people, or in our
circumstances.

People can be frustrating. People can be immature. People can
be undependable. Need I go on?

But the Lord is different! God is dependable. God is faithful.
God is honest. God is good. God is patient. God is kind. God is
understanding. God is merciful and gracious.

MALACHI 3:6 NLT
6 "I am the LORD, and I do not change. That is why you
descendants of Jacob are not already destroyed.

When we focus on our circumstances, or on what people do, we
can lose our joy quickly.

But with a true understanding of what God is really like, we
cannot help but rejoice because of His goodness and greatness.

If you are not sure what God is really like, then look at Jesus
Christ in the pages of the Four Gospels in the New Testament.
Jesus Christ perfectly revealed to us what God is like.

SAY THIS: I will keep my focus on the goodness and greatness of
the Lord and rejoice in Him.
