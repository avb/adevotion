God Is Rich In Mercy

EPHESIANS 2:4 NKJ
4 But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with
which He loved us,

The devil promotes the lie that God is mad at people and
anxious to condemn them, but the Bible says that God is rich in
mercy.

Mercy means not getting what we deserve.

Rich means an abundant supply -- more than enough.

The Bible says 41 times of the Lord that "His mercy endures
forever." Psalm 136 makes this statement in every verse.

PSALM 136:1 NKJ
1 Oh, give thanks to the LORD, for He is good! For His mercy
endures forever.

We may look at people and think they don't deserve another
chance. They may have blown it again and again and they may
seem hopeless to us. But God looks at people differently. He
looks at them through eyes of Love and sees their potential and
so shows mercy.

Yes, God is against sin. But it's because He loves us, and
knows how harmful sin is.

SAY THIS: God is more merciful than I have realized. God has
plenty of mercy.
