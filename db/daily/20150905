God Cannot Lie

TITUS 1:2 NKJ
2 in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised
before time began,

It's not just that God has decided He will not lie -- He CANNOT
lie.

God only speaks truth!

JOHN 17:17 NKJ
17 "Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth.

Whatever God says comes to pass. God cannot lie, because
anything He says will come into being -- even if it did not
exist before He said it.

GENESIS 1:3 NKJ
3 Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light.

So God's Word is ultimate reality! More real, and lasting, than
anything we can presently see.

God cannot lie because it is contrary to His nature. God's
nature is one of selfless love for others. His nature is not to
deceive. It is natural for God to be truthful and never to
deceive.

NUMBERS 23:19 NLT
19 God is not a man, so he does not lie. He is not human, so he
does not change his mind. Has he ever spoken and failed to act?
Has he ever promised and not carried it through?

HEBREWS 6:18 NLT
18 So God has given both his promise and his oath. These two
things are unchangeable because it is impossible for God to
lie. Therefore, we who have fled to him for refuge can have
great confidence as we hold to the hope that lies before us.

This is what makes the foundation of our relationship with God
so solid -- God has given us His Word -- which cannot fail. If
we are ever presented with evidence contrary to what God says,
we can know we are being presented with a lie. For it is
impossible for God to lie.

God cannot lie because it is not His nature, and because
whatever He speaks will happen.

SAY THIS: My God never lies. He is truth.
