Change Your Name

REVELATION 2:17 NIV
17 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the
churches. To him who overcomes, I will give some of the hidden
manna. I will also give him a white stone with a new name
written on it, known only to him who receives it.

Jesus changed Simon's name to Peter, which means a rock.

God changed Abram's name to Abraham, which means father of a
multitude.

Jacob's name was changed to Israel.

God's messenger called Gideon a "mighty man of valor" when he
saw himself as a fearful loser.

2 CORINTHIANS 5:17 NIV
17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the
old has gone, the new has come!

As a Christian believer, you are a new creation in Christ, and
you are no longer a loser.

So quit calling yourself a loser -- or any negative name. Now
that you are in Christ, those negative names do not fit. Accept
the new name God gave you: "Winner." (This is what overcomer
means!)

1 JOHN 5:4 NIV
4 for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the
victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.

Is it that easy? It involves more than just calling yourself a
new name, but if you fail to change the way you talk about
yourself, and the way you think about yourself, you will
continue in the same old patterns of defeat.

You must begin to see yourself as God sees you, to see yourself
as you can become.

Consider calling yourself some of the following names which
reflect what the New Testament reveals about your new identity
in Christ.

Forgiven
Forgiver
Child Of God
Bold
Confident
Patient
Kind
Strong
Righteous
Rich
Healthy
Blessed
Joyful

SAY THIS: I am a new person in Christ, and God has given me
some new names.
