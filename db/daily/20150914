Jesus Is The Resurrection

JOHN 11:25 NKJ
25 Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He
who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live.

What did Jesus mean by saying He is the resurrection?

Resurrection is not just an event, but a person: the Lord Jesus
Christ. He is our resurrection. Those who are united with Jesus
Christ through their belief in Him experience His resurrection
life, even now.

1 JOHN 5:12 NKJ
12 He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of
God does not have life.

It also means that because of our union with Christ Jesus,
death cannot hold us captive. Even though we may pass through
death, it cannot hold us.

Because Jesus lives in us, death cannot hold us any more than
death was able to hold Jesus.

In Jesus Christ we have the guarantee of resurrection and
eternal life.

SAY THIS: Jesus Christ is alive! Because He lives in me, I
shall continue to live, also. Death is defeated!
