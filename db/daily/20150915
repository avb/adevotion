Enjoy Life

PSALM 118:24 GWN
24 This is the day the LORD has made. Let's rejoice and be glad
today!

God does not want us to be sad and depressed. God intends for
us to enjoy life.

Of course, this life is not the end. Eternity with God is most
important. And there is nothing wrong with sacrificing
something in this life for the purpose of obtaining something
better in the next phase of our life with God in Heaven. But
that should not stop us from enjoying this life.

You may be in prison. But you can still rejoice in God's
goodness. You can study and learn. You may even be able to see
more clearly mankind's need for a Savior, and so appreciate
God's plan of salvation even more.

Learn to rejoice in and enjoy what many would call the small
things in life. Smell the flowers. Enjoy the colors God
created. Marvel at the complexity of God's creation and His
great ability.

1 TIMOTHY 6:17 NKJ
17 . . . God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy.

Enjoy the diversity of people God created. He made us all
different, yet all the same in many ways, such as our desire
for love and acceptance.

You may be in a wheelchair. But you can still appreciate all
the beauty that God created. You can pray for others. No matter
where you are, or what your circumstances may be, you can still
enjoy the presence of the Lord and fellowship with Him.

PSALM 16:11 NKJ
11 You will show me the path of life; In Your presence is
fullness of joy; At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.

So live in the awareness of God's presence and His great love
for you. Be thankful for every blessing, and enjoy life.

SAY THIS: God's will is for me to enjoy life with Him,
regardless of my circumstances.
