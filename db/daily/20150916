Bad News

PHILIPPIANS 4:8 NKJ
8 Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things
are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure,
whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report,
if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy --
meditate on these things.

The devil wants us to feed on bad news. God wants us to feed on
good news. Which will you choose?

Bad news promotes fear. Good news promotes faith.

We live in a society addicted to news. What we get is mostly
entertainment packaged as news, designed mostly to keep you
watching, not to actually inform you of truth. Through it the
world offers its views designed to manipulate your thinking and
believing.

Our news program's most glaring fault is that they leave God
out. God is at work around the world. But when do you ever see
a report on the good things God is doing?

Commercial news programs, of necessity, focus on sensational
and bad news items, simply to keep people's attention, so they
can sell products through advertising, and stay in business.

What is the result of feeding in all this bad news? Does it
make you feel better? Does it encourage you? Does it make you a
better person?

As a citizen you do have a responsibility to be informed on
some issues. But most people can do so without spending
significant amounts of time each day.

Many people spend hours each day listening to the "news" yet
find no time to read the Bible, or listen to teaching that will
build their faith and improve their life.

We are in a fight of faith. The devil is out to diminish, or
even steal our faith in God. How smart is it for a Christian
believer to spend time allowing the enemy to fill their ears,
eyes, and thoughts?

1 TIMOTHY 6:12 NKJ
12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to
which you were also called and have confessed the good
confession in the presence of many witnesses.

SAY THIS: I will invest my time in God's good news.
