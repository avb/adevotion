You Are Born To Win

1 JOHN 5:4 NIV
4 for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the
victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.

God does not expect any of His children to be failures.

There is nothing wrong with failing. It's part of learning. No
child learns to walk without falling down multiple times. But
they do not stay down, they get back up.

No one is a failure until they accept and believe they are a
failure.

Growth is a process. We learn and then make adjustments. No one
is born mature.

So don't be discouraged by your present state. Don't give up
just because you have fallen over and over. Get up and go
again!

You are a child of God if Jesus is your Lord, and God placed
within you everything you need to be a winner -- an overcomer.
As you trust in Him, and keep on keeping on, you can walk in
victory.

SAY THIS: Because of Jesus, I am born again to win!
