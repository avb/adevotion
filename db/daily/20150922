God Allows What You Allow

MATTHEW 18:18 CEV
18 I promise you that God in heaven will allow whatever you
allow on earth, but he will not allow anything you don't allow.

(Many translations use the words "bind" and "loose" in this
verse. Binding and loosing is a Hebrew idiom for exercising
authority. It means to prohibit and permit.)

When God created mankind He gave us authority to rule on earth.

GENESIS 1:26 NKJ
26 Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to
Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the
earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."

That means we have the right and the responsibility to make
choices.

Our choices are expressed through the words we speak. So
through our words we express our will and exercise our
authority.

It is important to understand that God has given us choices. We
MUST choose.

DEUTERONOMY 30:19 NKJ
19 "I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you,
that I have set before you life and death, blessing and
cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your
descendants may live;

So instead of blaming God for our situations, we should wake up
and realize God has given us a part to play. We cannot just sit
around and expect God to do what He has told us to do.

For example, the New Testament tells us we are to resist the
devil (James 4:7). So if the devil has any place in our life
the fault is ours -- not Gods. Remember that whatever steals,
kills, or destroys is from the devil, not God (John 10:10). So
you have authority to resist anything and everything that would
try to steal, kill, or destroy what is yours. That also means
you have the responsibility to do so.

You must speak to storms, just as Jesus did. If you don't speak
to the storms of life, then don't blame God when they wreck
your life.

SAY THIS: I will not allow the devil to take what belongs to
me.
