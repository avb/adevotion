When You Hurt, You Are Not Alone

HEBREWS 13:5 ESV
5 . . . he has said, "I will never leave you nor forsake you."

Jesus understands. He knows how it feels to be betrayed,
abandoned, hated. Jesus knows what it feels like to hurt.

He lived in a body just like you have. He was just as human as
you are.

HEBREWS 4:15 ESV
15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize
with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been
tempted as we are, yet without sin.

Some people hurt so badly that they feel it might give them
some relief if others felt what they felt. Probably many people
hurt others in an unconscious attempt to at least have someone
understand the pain they are feeling.

But you are NEVER alone when you are feeling hurt. Jesus
promised He would NEVER leave you or forsake you. He is there
with you, and He understands. He is not there to condemn you,
but to help you as much as you will allow Him to help you.

Too often when people are hurt they mistakenly blame God
instead of realizing He did not cause their pain but is there
to help them and heal their hurt. Just like a good parent is
there to comfort and take care of their child, so God is with
us.

Some might say, "If God really is with me, then why did this
bad thing happen to me in the first place?" or "If God is with
me, then why does He not just automatically fix everything and
make every bad thing go away?"

We may not know all the answers to those questions, but we know
there are answers. And we know that God loves us more than we
can even understand because He proved it at Calvary on the
cross.

So you can trust God. He loves you. He is with you now, and He
will be with you tomorrow.

SAY THIS: No matter what I face, I will never have to face it
alone, for Jesus is with me.
