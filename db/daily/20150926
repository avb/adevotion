Enjoy The Lord

PSALM 37:4 NKJ
4 Delight yourself also in the LORD, And He shall give you the
desires of your heart.

You should enjoy the Lord -- not just serve Him out of
obligation.

If you have a friend you enjoy being with, it is something you
look forward to, not a burden or obligation.

PHILIPPIANS 4:4 NKJ
4 Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice!

God is the most unselfish being in the universe. His
instruction and concern is not for Himself, but for others. So
He does not try to get you to draw near to Him so He can feel
important, but for your benefit.

PSALM 100:2 NET
2 Worship the LORD with joy! Enter his presence with joyful
singing!

The reason you need to worship God is because you will be
blessed. I usually have a daily time when I shut out other
things and pray because I enjoy it and it benefits me. (It is
also true that God is worthy, but I do not do it for that
reason alone.)

God gave Himself to us so we could enjoy Him and choose to love
Him.

It is a mistake to view prayer as a legalistic obligation.
Prayer is a privilege. Time with God is a privilege. It should
never be looked at as a duty. We are not doing it for God's
sake, but for our sake.

Would you like it if your friend or spouse only spent time with
you as an obligation, instead of enjoying it?

God wants you to do right. God wants you to draw near to Him.
But He does not want you to do it because you were forced, but
because you chose to do so. This is why God gave us a New
Covenant, based not on law, but on His grace and our trust in
Him.

SAY THIS: I will enjoy the Lord for He is good!
