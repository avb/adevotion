God Loves A Cheerful Giver

2 CORINTHIANS 9:7 NLT
7 You must each decide in your heart how much to give. And
don't give reluctantly or in response to pressure. "For God
loves a person who gives cheerfully."

We all tend to like those similar to us. God is a giver, so it
is only natural for Him to especially appreciate people who are
givers.

JOHN 3:16 NLT
16 "For God loved the world so much that he gave . . . .

1 TIMOTHY 6:17b NLT
17 Their trust should be in God, who richly gives . . . .

Cheerful givers are not the only people God loves -- God loves
the whole world. So the verse probably means God loves for
people to give cheerfully.

Let's think about what kind of a person is a cheerful giver.

It takes both faith and love to be a cheerful giver.

If you don't care for others, at best, you might occasionally
give reluctantly when it benefits you in some way. So cheerful
and continued giving is a sign of love and evidence you care
for others.

Faith is also necessary to be a giver. Without confidence that
you will have enough in the future, it is unlikely you will
give cheerfully.

Faith pleases God. God always encourages faith and tells people
not to fear.

God also loves to see people blessed. And according to God's
Word, the person who gives has blessings headed their
direction. For God says that if we give, it will be given unto
us again.

LUKE 6:38 NLT
38 Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in
full -- pressed down, shaken together to make room for more,
running over, and poured into your lap. The amount you give
will determine the amount you get back."

Because God desires abundance for us all, He is pleased when we
give because He knows giving is a key to receiving. It is the
law of God: in the measure we sow, we shall also reap.

Giving is love in action. Giving is proof of love. Love is not
something we can see. But we can see what love produces:
giving.

SAY THIS: Lord, please help me to be a cheerful giver.
