Who Will Govern?

ISAIAH 9:7 NLT
7 His government and its peace will never end. He will rule
with fairness and justice from the throne of his ancestor David
for all eternity. The passionate commitment of the LORD of
Heaven's Armies will make this happen!

This is the question we must face, both as individuals and as
nations. Who, or what, will be our "king?" Who will be our
"supreme court?" (By "supreme court" I do not mean a group of
people who meet in a building, but the final authority that we
base our ideas, principles, and actions upon.)

We have a choice. We can choose Jesus Christ and His Kingdom of
Love, Light, and Life. Or we can choose selfishness and
darkness and death.

Whenever we reject Jesus and His Word from ruling over us,
whether as individuals or as a nation, we choose darkness.

I do not advocate any religious control over government. What
we need instead is people in government who know the truth and
will speak and act in truth and not out of self interest. We
need people in secular government who are submitted to Jesus as
their Lord and are willing to live and govern with His love for
mankind, instead of acting in self interest.

MATTHEW 6:10 NLT
10 May your Kingdom come soon. May your will be done on earth,
as it is in heaven.

SAY THIS: Jesus, and those who have died with Him to self
interest, are qualified, and should be selected to govern.
