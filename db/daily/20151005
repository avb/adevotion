Be An Encourager

1 THESSALONIANS 5:11,14 ESV
11 Therefore encourage one another and build one another up,
just as you are doing.
14 And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the
fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all.

People accomplish more if someone believes in them and
encourages them.

All of us can grow fainthearted without encouragement.

HEBREWS 3:13 NIV
13 But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called
Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's
deceitfulness.

HEBREWS 10:24-25 NLT
24 Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love
and good works.
25 And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people
do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of
his return is drawing near.

PROVERBS 12:25 NLT
25 Worry weighs a person down; an encouraging word cheers a
person up.

Just one encouraging word can make a big difference in
someone's life.

So encourage someone today!

PROVERBS 21:19 NLT
19 It is better to live alone in the desert than with a crabby,
complaining wife.

Whether you are a husband, a wife, or a child, no one enjoys
being with a crabby, complaining person. But everyone loves to
be around someone who encourages them.

SAY THIS: I will aim to encourage others.
