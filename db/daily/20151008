Weep With Those Who Weep

ROMANS 12:15 KJV
15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that
weep.

There are times when we should share the grief of others,
understand what they are feeling, and support them in their
sorrow.

JOHN 11:35 KJV
35 Jesus wept.

Jesus lived a perfect life. He is our model as well as our Lord
and Savior. If Jesus found it appropriate to weep at times,
then it is appropriate for us, also.

In general we should encourage people. We should try to get
them to see the positive side of things and to trust in the
Lord, and even to rejoice in Him. The Bible tells us to rejoice
in the Lord always. But people are not perfect in acting in
faith, and we can't force them to do something.

So sometimes it is not appropriate to try to "cheer up
someone." The Bible says there is a time to weep.

ECCLESIASTES 3:4 KJV
4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a
time to dance;

Sometimes what is needed is not trying to change a person, but
just letting them know you care about them. By your presence
and your actions you are saying, "You matter to me. When you
feel bad, it affects me, because I care about you. You are
important to me, and when you hurt, I hurt because you are
hurting."

PROVERBS 25:20 NLT
20 Singing cheerful songs to a person with a heavy heart is
like taking someone's coat in cold weather or pouring vinegar
in a wound.

GENESIS 23:2 KJV
2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land
of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for
her.

When our loved ones depart for Heaven, we should rejoice for
them. But it is natural for us to weep because of our loss. We
should not sorrow as the world does. We have a hope they do not
have. But it is not wrong to display emotion. God made us
emotional beings. Emotion is not wrong unless we let it control
us and lead us away from doing God's will.

SAY THIS: Help me Lord to rejoice and to weep at the right
times.
