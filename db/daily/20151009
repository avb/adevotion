Always Be Thankful

1 THESSALONIANS 5:18 NLT
18 No matter what happens, always be thankful, for this is
God's will for you who belong to Christ Jesus.

Bad things happen in life sometimes. There are times we don't
understand what is happening or why. But we can always be
thankful for many things:

God loves us.

Jesus died for us.

Our sins are forgiven.

Jesus has promised to never leave us.

God is our Father and He is faithful.

We have an eternal home in Heaven.

What we choose to focus on determines our attitude. While we
may face problems, we don't have to let those problems become
our focus. We can choose to give thanks and praise God for His
goodness and faithfulness.

Imagine how discouraged that will make the devil feel!

Also, think of the pleasure it must bring our Father God when
we stay in faith and focus on Him, instead of being distracted
by the stuff the devil does trying to steal our faith.

If you are always thankful, the bad things that do happen to
you will lose their ability to really harm you. For God will
work in your life.

SAY THIS: I choose to always be thankful to God, no matter what
happens.
