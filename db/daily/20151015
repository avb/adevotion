Righteousness, Peace, Joy

ROMANS 14:17 NKJ
17 for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but
righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

Here is a description of the Kingdom of God: righteousness and
peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

Righteousness means everything being right.

God has given us the gift of righteousness (Romans 5:17). That
means He has put us in right standing with Himself. He has said
that everything is right between us and Him. Sin no longer
separates us from God, because the precious blood of Jesus has
cleansed us and we are forgiven by God.

Because we have right standing with God (righteousness), we
have peace. There is no more struggle. God is not mad at us.
God is on our side.

Peace means more than the absence of conflict. Peace means
nothing broken and nothing missing. Peace includes the idea of
prosperity -- having everything needful in abundance with no
lack.

When you are right with God and have peace -- nothing missing
and nothing broken -- you will have joy.

You can look at this as a progression, righteousness produces
peace, and when you have righteousness and peace, joy will
result.

God's Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. It is a kingdom of
love. It is a kingdom where everything is right. In it there is
no imperfection and no lack. It is a kingdom of peace. There is
never any conflict because there is no selfishness. It is a
kingdom of joy. Everyone rejoices because of the goodness of
God.

God's kingdom includes everywhere God reigns. In the world
there is trouble (John 16:33). But by faith in Jesus, it can be
overcome (1 John 5:5).

SAY THIS: Because of God's gift of righteousness, I have peace
and joy as a member of His Kingdom.
