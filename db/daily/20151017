Thank You!

1 THESSALONIANS 5:18 NLT
18 Be thankful in all circumstances, for this is God's will for
you who belong to Christ Jesus.

When you don't know what to say or do -- say "Thank You!"

Sometimes we feel like we don't know what to do. We wonder what
God's perfect will is.

Certainly the will of God is not for us to start worrying and
being fearful about missing His will. Instead we should stay in
faith, knowing that God is working and guiding us even when we
are not aware of it.

God is not responsible for the bad things that come our way in
life -- the devil and people are to blame.

But when we start complaining and criticizing, we step out of
faith, joy, and peace. These spiritual forces (the "fruit" of
the spirit) are for our protection.

So we can, and should, always thank God at all times. We should
develop the habit of having an attitude of gratitude.

Our God is amazing! He can turn bad things around and take the
sting out of them.

When we stay in faith, always being thankful, the sting is
removed from the evil that comes against us. Then, instead of
destroying us, it can become a stepping-stone to take us to a
higher place of blessing.

So while God is not actually responsible for any of the bad
things that happen, we should be thankful always -- no matter
what happens.

An attitude of constant gratitude provides a shield of faith
protecting you and allowing God to freely act in your life,
bringing blessing and deliverance.

So when something bad happens in your life, don't complain.
Don't criticize God, or people. Don't beat yourself over the
head. Just begin (and continue) to say things like:

Thank You Lord that you are with me to guide me and help me,
that You love me, that You are working in my life, that You
protect me and preserve me and deliver me from evil, and that
no weapon formed against me shall prosper or prevail!

The most appropriate words you can ever speak are "Thank You!"

SAY THIS: Thank You, Lord Jesus!
