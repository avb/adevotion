Thank God For You!

2 THESSALONIANS 1:3 NLT
3 Dear brothers and sisters, we can't help but thank God for
you, because your faith is flourishing and your love for one
another is growing.

God made you for a purpose. God has a plan. You are not an
accident.

You may not have discovered where you fit and what your purpose
is yet, but God has not forgotten you. He is still at work.

Most of us will not affect the whole world, or even our entire
city. That does not mean you are not important.

The Bible uses the picture of a human body to illustrate the
Body of Christ. Not every part is ever seen, but every part is
important.

1 CORINTHIANS 12:22 NLT 
22 In fact, some parts of the body that seem weakest and least 
important are actually the most necessary.

Even if no one knows the part you are doing, God does. You are
important to God -- important enough to die for.

God has a plan for you, and it lasts far beyond this life that
we can now see.

SAY THIS: Thank God for me!
