Love Your Neighbor As Yourself

MARK 12:31 NKJ
31 "And the second, like it, is this: `You shall love your
neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater
than these."

Eight times the Bible tells us to love our neighbor as we love
our self.

Clearly, God considers this important. But what does it mean?

It means we should not just look out for our own interests, but
also for those around us.

PHILIPPIANS 2:4 NKJ
4 Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but
also for the interests of others.

Who is our neighbor?

Anyone -- and everyone -- who is near-by. If they are near us
they are, at that moment, our neighbor. And according to God's
Word, we have an obligation to love them.

What does this word "love" mean in the original Greek language
of the New Testament.

It is "agapao," the word used of the kind of love God has for
us. It gives and asks for nothing in return. It gives without
waiting for the other person to love first. It is not a selfish
love, but cares about the welfare and happiness of the person
being loved.

To truly love your neighbor as yourself, you need to be a born
again child of God. Love is of God, and to show this kind of
love you need to be born of God (1 John 4:7). Without His love
continually flowing out of your heart, it will not be possible.

SAY THIS: With God's help, I will love my neighbor as I love
myself.
