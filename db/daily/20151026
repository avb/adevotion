God Encourages

2 CORINTHIANS 7:6 NLT
6 But God, who encourages those who are discouraged, encouraged
us by the arrival of Titus.

God usually works through people.

The encouragement and love you receive through others, actually
has its source in God.

So as we show love and offer encouragement, we can be God's
mouth and hands extended to those around us.

2 TIMOTHY 4:2 GWN
2 Be ready to spread the word whether or not the time is right.
Point out errors, warn people, and encourage them. Be very
patient when you teach.

As you can see from this Scripture, one of the main purposes of
the Word is to encourage us.

HEBREWS 10:25 NLT
25 And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people
do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of
his return is drawing near.

A main purpose of Christian believers meeting together is for
encouragement. We are to encourage one another.

Scripture tells us that Jesus does not give up on people just
because they are weak.

MATTHEW 12:20 NLT
20 He will not crush the weakest reed or put out a flickering
candle. Finally he will cause justice to be victorious.

Many are weak and need our input to give them strength to
continue. Many more would overcome in life if they had more
encouragement.

Jesus desires to help people. If you are a member of His Body
on earth, His plan is to work through you today.

SAY THIS: I will let God encourage others today through me.
