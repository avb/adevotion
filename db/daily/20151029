Hundredfold Blessing

MARK 10:29-30 NKJ
29 So Jesus answered and said, "Assuredly, I say to you, there
is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or father
or mother or wife or children or lands, for My sake and the
gospel's,
30 "who shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time --
houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and
lands, with persecutions -- and in the age to come, eternal
life.

Many think it is extreme to believe God could multiply their
giving by 100 times. But if you look at God's creation, you see
that is not abnormal.

One corn seed can easily produce 800 kernels of corn from one
plant. So it is not extreme to think God can multiply a seed
100 times.

GENESIS 26:12-14 NKJ
12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year a
hundredfold; and the Lord blessed him.
13 The man began to prosper, and continued prospering until he
became very prosperous;
14 for he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds
and a great number of servants. So the Philistines envied him.

What happened to Issac can happen to you. God does not play
favorites.

Hearing, understanding, and acting on God's Word is the key.

MATTHEW 13:23 NKJ
23 "But he who received seed on the good ground is he who hears
the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and
produces: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty."

SAY THIS: I believe God can provide a hundredfold return of
blessing for anything I give for His sake.
