Don't Let Your Heart Be Troubled

JOHN 14:1 NIV
1 "Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also
in me.

Because Jesus told us to NOT LET our hearts be troubled, it
means we can do it. Jesus would never tell us to do something
that was impossible for us to do.

JOHN 14:27 NIV
27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give
to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled
and do not be afraid.

JOHN 16:33 NIV
33 "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have
peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I
have overcome the world."

As this verse indicates, believers are not exempt from trouble
in this world. But Jesus the Victor is always with us to lead
us into victory, no matter what we may face.

PROVERBS 4:23 NLT
23 Guard your heart above all else, for it determines the
course of your life.

ISAIAH 26:3 NLT
3 You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in you, all
whose thoughts are fixed on you!

The information you feed into your consciousness determines
what you believe.

If your heart is troubled, it means you are looking at, and
feeding in, the wrong information.

What you feed on, listen to, and watch is important.

Look to God and His Word. Refuse to doubt God's never-failing
love and provision.

SAY THIS: I will not allow my heart to be troubled, but I will
trust in Jesus.
