God Is A Person

2 CORINTHIANS 13:14 LB
14 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. May
God's love and the Holy Spirit's friendship be yours. Paul

God has feelings, emotions, and desires.

God does not enjoy being neglected any more than you do.

God has none of the weaknesses we associate with people, but
nevertheless, God is a person.

God knows, thinks, and communicates.

God is not just a force. God has personality. We are made in
His image. We are like God, even though the image has been
marred by sin.

God is a Father. His intention is no less than a close,
personal relationship with you.

1 CORINTHIANS 1:9 ICB
9 God is faithful. He is the One who has called you to share
life with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

God desires a relationship with you. But a good relationship
cannot be one-sided.

Love, respect, and communication are essential in any healthy
relationship.

When we ignore God and go about our lives like He doesn't even
exist, we can't expect our relationship to flourish.

And if the only time we talk to Him about anything is when we
run into a problem we can't handle, what kind of relationship
is that?

Fortunately for us, God is not touchy and doesn't treat us the
way we treat Him. But for us to continue treating God in such a
way is wrong.

It's time for us to grow up, quit acting like self-centered
babies, and treat God as He deserves.

SAY THIS: I will not neglect or ignore God.
