Focus On Helping Others

PHILIPPIANS 2:4 NLT
4 Don't look out only for your own interests, but take an
interest in others, too.

It's not unusual for someone to feel like life is not worth
living. Many, if not most, feel this way some time.

My recommendation for those who feel this way is to begin
focusing on helping others. Lift the burdens of others and make
their life better. That will produce a life with meaning and
joy.

Only those who live to help others will ever find true
satisfaction in life.

It may seem like other plans people use to make themselves
happy are working in the short term, but in the long run they
always fail to bring lasting joy, fulfillment, and
satisfaction.

If you desire to be like God -- who is happy and joyful -- then
be a helper.

God helps everyone. He produces and gives an abundance of good
things for everyone. Air, water, food -- the list is endless.

At the end of your life here on earth, only what you have done
to help others will be valuable to you. All that you did for
only selfish reasons will be a disappointment.

The best tonic for depression is to get involved in helping
others.

When you begin to help others, it is amazing how your own
problems seem to shrink.

Do you want your life to be better? Then focus on what you can
do to make life better for others.

SAY THIS: I will act like God and help people.
