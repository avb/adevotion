What Is Worship?

MATTHEW 4:10 NLT
10 "Get out of here, Satan," Jesus told him. "For the
Scriptures say, 'You must worship the Lord your God and serve
only him.'"

Today we have what we call "worship services" that usually
consist mainly of singing songs and listening to a sermon. Many
also have "worship leaders" whose job is to lead the singing at
their church meetings.

There is nothing wrong with that. When we focus our attention
on the Lord, singing to Him from the depths of our heart,
giving time and attention to Him and His Word, instead of other
things, it indeed can be true worship.

But worship, as taught in the Bible, is certainly not limited
to these things.

In the New Testament, the main word used for worship can be
summarized as submission, or an attitude of submission because
of profound reverence.

In the Bible, worship is always demonstrated by doing
something. It may be bowing down prostrate on the ground before
someone. And it is often connected with giving -- a sacrifice.
But worship is always an action that demonstrates how much
something is valued.

Worship is a way of showing "worth-ship."

We show how much we value something by what we are willing to
give up to get it.

The only way of measuring how much we value someone is by what
we give to them, including such things as time, attention,
respect, loyalty, love, devotion, and also material things.

JOHN 4:23 NIV
23 Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true
worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for
they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.

SAY THIS: I will be a true worshiper of God.
