Sleep Is A Gift From God

PSALM 127:2 NKJ
2 . . . He gives His beloved sleep.

PROVERBS 3:24 NKJ
24 When you lie down, you will not be afraid; yes, you will lie
down and your sleep will be sweet.

PSALM 3:5 NKJ
5 I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the Lord sustained me.

PSALM 4:8 NKJ
8 I will both lie down in peace, and sleep; for You alone, O
Lord, make me dwell in safety.

We can trust in God and sleep even when we face the storms of
life, just as Jesus and Peter did in the following verses.

MARK 4:38 NKJ
38 But He was . . . asleep on a pillow. And they awoke Him and
said to Him, "Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?"

ACTS 12:6 NKJ
6 And when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter
was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers . . .

Jesus Approves Rest

MARK 6:31 NKJ
31 And He said to them, "Come aside by yourselves to a deserted
place and rest a while." For there were many coming and going,
and they did not even have time to eat.

MATTHEW 11:28-29 NKJ
28 "Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I
will give you rest.
29 "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle
and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

While rest is clearly part of God's will for us, we are also
cautioned in Proverbs against sleeping too much. Balance is
important. Different people may require different amounts of
sleep to function at their best. You should seek God for wisdom
in this area.

SAY THIS: God gives me sweet, sound sleep.
