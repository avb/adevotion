You Are Writing A Story

2 CORINTHIANS 3:2B NLT
2 Your lives are a letter written in our hearts; everyone can
read it and recognize our good work among you.

Every day by your actions you are "writing" your story.

One purpose of life on earth is to give us each an opportunity
to "write" our own story, which we will be able to share and
enjoy throughout eternity. We are here to learn, and what we
experience and learn will be shared with many.

Humans love stories. Facts and figures can sometimes be boring,
but when anyone tells what happened to them, it usually draws
our attention.

Everyone knows and loves the story of David and Goliath.

We all love a good story. But what does every good story
require? It must involve some problem or difficulty that is
ultimately overcome so there is a happy ending. These are the
stories we love to hear.

The good news is that, because of God's love, your story will
at least have a happy ending. But you can make your story more
interesting by the choices you make now.

As you know, there can be many problems and difficulties in a
story. But how the story finishes is what's most important.

You may be facing some terrible circumstances right now. But
your story is not over. The trouble you are facing now is what
will make your story interesting as it is told in the future.
You can overcome! God is there to help you! You can face
difficulties with God's help and overcome (just like David did
with Goliath.)

So don't judge your story too quickly. Life is not over. Your
story is still being written. Some of the best and most
exciting parts are still to come.

It's too soon for a final judgment.

SAY THIS: My story is going to bring God glory with a happy
ending.
