Magnify God

ACTS 10:46a NKJ
46 For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.

PSALM 34:3 NKJ
3 Oh, magnify the LORD with me, And let us exalt His name
together.

In the New Testament, the word translated "magnify" is the
Greek word "megaluno." It means to make great or enlarge.

We certainly cannot make God any greater, but we can perceive
Him as greater in our lives. In other words, what we think of
God can be enlarged.

How can we do this?

What you focus your attention on will seem bigger, because you
are choosing to let it occupy your time and thinking.

Very small objects can block very large ones. A small coin in
front of your eye can block the sun from view. Yet the sun is
infinitely larger than the coin. It's the placement in your
life that determines how big things seem to you.

An airplane in the sky can look very small, though in reality
it is huge. That is only because you are far away from it.

When Scripture talks of magnifying God, we assume it meant they
were praising God and talking of His greatness and goodness.

Does God seem big and capable in your thinking? If not, then
magnify Him!

Do the problems you face seem like giants? Then remove your
attention and focus from the problems -- de-magnify them -- and
focus on the Lord. To shrink the problem, magnify the solution.

The more you think about a problem you are facing, the larger
it can seem. The more you think about God, what He has created,
and all He has done, the smaller the problem will look compared
to God.

God IS greater than any problem or any situation you face. You
just need to realize it and quit letting the problem be your
focus.

Praise God and magnify Him!

SAY THIS: I will magnify God in my life.
