Laugh At Sickness

NEHEMIAH 8:10b NKJ
10 Do not sorrow, for the joy of the LORD is your strength."

Letting joy flow allows spiritual strength to flow in your
life.

Laughing is a way to allow the joy already in your spirit to
flow. (Your spirit is the part of you that is a born again new
creation in union with Christ.)

Medical science has documented the beneficial effects of
laughter on our health. Experts tell us that every time we
laugh our immune system is boosted.

PROVERBS 17:22 NKJ
22 A merry heart does good, like medicine, But a broken spirit
dries the bones.

The devil wants you to become discouraged and disheartened, to
feel like a hopeless, helpless victim.

But sickness, at its worst, is only temporary. It will not last
forever. Jesus defeated sickness and redeemed you from it at
the cost of His own precious blood.

REVELATION 21:4 NKJ
4 "And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there
shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be
no more pain, for the former things have passed away."

The price for your healing has been paid by the sacrifice of
Jesus Christ.

1 PETER 2:24 NKJ
24 who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that
we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness -- by
whose stripes you were healed.

Healing belongs to you, but does not come automatically. It
must be possessed. (See www.healing-book.com for more evidence.)

Real joy is not just a feeling but a life force coming from the
Spirit of God (Galatians 5:22). In the midst of trials the joy
of the Lord will protect you from being defeated and destroyed.
It will strengthen you and lift you up above the troubles.

Sickness tries to make you fear and worry. Laughing is a way to
resist that. Joy can be released through laughter.

Laughing is an expression of joy, victory, and contentment.
Laughter is a language of faith. Faith laughs!

SAY THIS: I will laugh at sickness.
