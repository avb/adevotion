Hope Until The End

HEBREWS 6:11 NKJ
11 And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence
to the full assurance of hope until the end,

This verse tells us we should never give up hope, which is a
positive expectation.

No matter how many failures you experience, nor how much time
has passed -- don't quit expecting a positive outcome in the
end.

What is the end? It is when you see your desire manifest -- or
when you see what should be your ultimate desire manifest,
being face-to-face with Jesus Christ.

Till then, keep on having an expectation of a positive outcome.

Look at a couple of other translations of Hebrews 6:11-12

HEBREWS 6:11-12 NJB
11 Our desire is that every one of you should go on showing the
same enthusiasm till the ultimate fulfilment of your hope,
12 never growing careless, but taking as your model those who
by their faith and perseverance are heirs of the promises.

HEBREWS 6:11-12 CJB
11 However, we want each one of you to keep showing the same
diligence right up to the end, when your hope will be realized;
12 so that you will not become sluggish, but will be imitators
of those who by their trust and patience are receiving what has
been promised.

Too many people give up and accept defeat too soon. They are
like a sports team that, just because it is not winning after
the first half of the game, decides to go home and not even
play the rest of the game.

It is always too soon to quit when you know you are going the
right direction. How can you know you are going the right
direction? By following the instructions and guidance of God's
Word, the Bible, and being led by His Spirit. When you are
doing God's will, keep on, no matter what.

SAY THIS: I will continue to have a positive expectation
because God is good and He is faithful.
