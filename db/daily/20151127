God's Family Plan

JOSHUA 24:15b NKJ
15 But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."

God's plan is a family plan. His will is for you to believe for
the salvation of all your relatives.

JOSHUA 2:13 NKJ
13 "and spare my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters,
and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death."

JOSHUA 6:23,25 NKJ
23 And the young men who had been spies went in and brought out
Rahab, her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she
had. So they brought out all her relatives and left them
outside the camp of Israel.
25 And Joshua spared Rahab the harlot, her father's household,
and all that she had . . . .

Rahab was a harlot who did not even belong to God's people. But
she asked for all her family to be saved, and they were. We
should stand in faith just as Rahab did and ask for the lives
of all our family members.

God allows all people to choose whether to receive Jesus. But
when you pray for and stand in faith for your loved ones, God
will do everything necessary to bring your family members to a
point where it will be easy for them to choose to receive
Jesus.

God is able to make His case and get the job done!

ACTS 16:31 NLT
31 They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be
saved, along with everyone in your household."

1 TIMOTHY 2:3-4 NKJ
3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our
Savior,
4 who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge
of the truth.

Whoever we pray for, we know it is God's will to save them.

SAY THIS: Thank you Lord for saving all my family!
