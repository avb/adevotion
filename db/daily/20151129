Heaven Is Real

2 CORINTHIANS 5:1 NLT
1 For we know that when this earthly tent we live in is taken
down (that is, when we die and leave this earthly body), we
will have a house in heaven, an eternal body made for us by God
himself and not by human hands.

If we expect the world to ever believe our message of Good
News, we should not live like this life is all there is.

As Christian believers we should live and die like we believe
the Bible, which clearly reveals this life is not the end.

As a believer in Jesus Christ, when we leave this body we
immediately enter into the realm of ultimate reality with the
Lord.

2 CORINTHIANS 5:8 NLT
8 Yes, we are fully confident, and we would rather be away from
these earthly bodies, for then we will be at home with the
Lord.

The spiritual realm is actually more real than the physical
realm.

If you care to investigate, you will find there are multitudes
of people who have visited Heaven and returned. Often it is
because of a near-death experience.

Unanimously, their report is that Heaven is too wonderful for
words. They try, but have trouble, expressing the glories and
the joys of Heaven. No one, after experiencing Heaven,
expressed a preference to continue living on earth.

1 PETER 1:4 NLT
4 and we have a priceless inheritance -- an inheritance that is
kept in heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond the reach of
change and decay.

Heaven is better -- in every way -- than earth. While we should
be faithful to fulfill our job here on earth and live out our
lives doing the will of God, being His representatives, when it
is time to depart we should not act like unbelievers.

As believers in Jesus Christ we have been delivered from the
fear of death. Death has no sting left for us. Death cannot
hurt us. We should not fear death.

SAY THIS: Heaven is real and I look forward to living there.
