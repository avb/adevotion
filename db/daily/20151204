Praise From God

JOHN 12:43 NLT
43 For they loved human praise more than the praise of God.

If we value what people can do more than we value what God can
do, we will be easily tempted to make wrong choices, just as
the Pharisees and rulers of Israel did.

JOHN 12:42-43 GWN
42 Many rulers believed in Jesus. However, they wouldn't admit
it publicly because the Pharisees would have thrown them out of
the synagogue.
43 They were more concerned about what people thought of them
than about what God thought of them.

What motivates you? Put another way: why do you do what you do?

Have you ever thought about what it would be like to have God
praise you? It's worth thinking about.

(We're talking about rewards, not acceptance with God or
getting into Heaven. We are not saved and put in right standing
with God on the basis of our good works, but solely as a gift
we receive by God's grace. Neither do we "earn" God's love
which is really an expression of His character. However, it is
still possible to be honored by God. Those who have done the
will of God will be rewarded.)

Most people are motivated by what other people think, or what
they think other people might think. In essence, this is the
fear of man, being mostly concerned about what people will
think, or how they will respond.

If you live for human praise you need to understand that even
if you obtain it, it will not last for long.

It is true that getting praise from God is not something that
can be expected quickly. Enjoying God's praise is evidently
something that happens primarily after this life. At least as
far as being praised publicly.

However, I value that quiet, inner assurance I experience when
I do something I know has pleased God. This is also a form of
"praise from God" encouraging us to do His will, even when
there seems to be no immediate outward results.

SAY THIS: God's approval is more important than people's
approval.
