How To Have A Great Marriage

It's simple -- but you will need God's help to do it.

JOHN 15:12 NIV
12 My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.

Love as Jesus loved! Be willing to lay down your life to bless
your spouse. Few would ever want to get rid of a spouse who
truly practices this principle.

The ingredients for having a great marriage are the same as
having any great relationship: communication, honesty,
commitment, kindness, and attention.

If your aim is to bless your spouse and make them happy, it is
very likely they will eventually respond by loving you.

If you are the only one in your marriage practicing this, it
can be difficult. But your only other choice is to treat them
badly in return. How can that produce anything good?

You are God's representative. He put you where you are so He
could express His love through you. God loves your spouse --
whether you think they deserve it or not.

The Bible teaches us to put the interests of others first.

ROMANS 12:10 NIV
10 Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one
another above yourselves.

Which is a higher priority for you: your happiness or your
spouse's happiness?

"But," you say, "I've done all that and they are not
reciprocating. They just take advantage of me."

First, without your efforts your marriage could already be dead
and gone. Second, you will be judged only for what you did in
life -- not what your spouse did. Third, God's law of giving
will eventually work: As you continue to give love -- love will
be returned to you.

Commit yourself to the happiness and well-being of your spouse.
Keep acting on God's Word and showing love to them. Put them
before yourself. God will work on your behalf.

SAY THIS: With God's help, I will have a great marriage.
