The Holy Spirit Is Your Guide

JOHN 16:13 NLT
13 When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all
truth. He will not speak on his own but will tell you what he
has heard. He will tell you about the future.

Jesus never said the Holy Spirit would instantly tell you the
whole truth on a subject, but He said the Holy Spirit would
GUIDE us into all truth.

A guide is someone who helps you find something. For a guide to
be of any benefit, you must be searching for something.

MATTHEW 7:7-8 NKJ
7 "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find;
knock, and it will be opened to you.
8 "For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and
to him who knocks it will be opened.

If you don't seek answers -- don't expect to find them.

The greatest obstacle to learning is thinking you already know
enough.

If you are satisfied with what you know, you will not be
searching for more answers -- so you have no need of a Guide to
help you.

Remember: truth sets you free (John 8:31-32). Lies keep you in
bondage. So if you are not enjoying perfect freedom, seek more
understanding of the truth.

The Holy Spirit is a perfect teacher. He guides us into the
truths we are ready and able to receive. Then He patiently
teaches us until we understand the lesson.

It is important to remember that guiding us into all truth is a
process. Even when you have not realized it, the Holy Spirit
has been at work in your life. He does not force knowledge on
you, but when you are hungry for truth, He will guide you in
the right direction.

SAY THIS: Jesus promised the Holy Spirit will guide me into all
truth.
