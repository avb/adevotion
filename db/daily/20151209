Teach Your Children

DEUTERONOMY 6:6-7 NKJ
6 "And these words which I command you today shall be in your
heart.
7 "You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall
talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the
way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.

God holds all parents responsible for teaching their children.
But that does not require some formal approach to instruction.
The best way is a natural flow of information as we go through
life.

God's Word tells us that teaching our children should happen
during the normal events of daily life. We can illustrate truth
and apply it to what happens every day, just as Jesus did with
His disciples.

We must also realize that everything our children see us do in
life is also unintentionally teaching them. Whatever they see
you do is a lesson your children are watching and learning
from.

If you never speak of God and His Word, it communicates to your
children that God is not very important to you. If you don't
read your Bible, don't expect your children to read the Bible.

It is also important to mean what you say, and say what you
mean -- to always tell the truth. If your children know you
don't keep your word, they won't expect God to keep His Word
either. So if you tell your child something, either do it, or
ask their forgiveness for not keeping your word.

Don't try to leave the responsibility for teaching your
children about God to someone else. You may not feel qualified
but God will help you. Just be honest with God and honest with
your children, and you will make progress with both.

SAY THIS: I will teach my children the knowledge of God.
