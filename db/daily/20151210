Believe!

JOHN 20:31 NKJ
31 but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the
Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in
His name.

"But how can I believe in an invisible God?"

The same way you believe in the wind. No one has ever seen the
wind. But we all see the effects of the wind.

You may not see God, but open your eyes and look around and you
will see God in action. In His marvelous creation, in people's
testimonies of God's provision and deliverance, in miracles
happening all over the earth, in answered prayer.

It is not necessary to see God, or feel God, to believe in Him!

JOHN 20:29 NKJ
29 Jesus said to him, "Thomas, because you have seen Me, you
have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have
believed."

If it was always easy to believe, there would be no reward
offered for believing. No one offers a reward or bonus for
doing something easy.

HEBREWS 11:6 NKJ
6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who
comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder
of those who diligently seek Him.

The Bible speaks of the fight of faith. That means you will
have a struggle with believing. Don't be surprised. Expect it.

1 TIMOTHY 6:12 NKJ
12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to
which you were also called and have confessed the good
confession in the presence of many witnesses.

JOHN 6:28-29 NKJ
28 Then they said to Him, "What shall we do, that we may work
the works of God?"
29 Jesus answered and said to them, "This is the work of God,
that you believe in Him whom He sent."

SAY THIS: I choose to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son 
of God, and His Word is truth.
