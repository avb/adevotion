Look Up!

LUKE 21:25,26,28 NKJ
25 "And there will be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the
stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity,
the sea and the waves roaring;
26 "men's hearts failing them from fear and the expectation of
those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of
heaven will be shaken.
28 "Now when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up
your heads, because your redemption draws near."

Unprecedented troubles seem to be sweeping the earth.

What should we do when we see these things happening?

Jesus said we should "look up and lift up our heads!" That is,
we should not be discouraged or disheartened by all the
troubles on earth, as if we have no hope. Instead we are to
continue in faith, knowing that our Lord will always take care
of us, and that our final redemption is drawing nearer.

We must remember that God is truly our Source and that He has
promised to never forsake us, but to always provide for us.

As we await the return of our Lord, we should actively continue
to be a witness of God's goodness by our life and testimony.
Our refusing to submit to fear and worry, but instead giving
thanks and praise to God, will be a witness to those around us.

SAY THIS: I will not be discouraged by all that is happening in
the world, but I will look to Jesus my Savior, Protector, and
Provider.
