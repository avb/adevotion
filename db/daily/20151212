God's Way Is Perfect

PSALM 18:30 NIV
30 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is
flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.

People blame God for many things. But they are wrong. God is
perfect in all He does. When we have full information and see
the complete picture, we will not be able to find any fault in
God.

1 CORINTHIANS 13:12 NLT
12 Now we see things imperfectly as in a cloudy mirror, but
then we will see everything with perfect clarity. All that I
know now is partial and incomplete, but then I will know
everything completely, just as God now knows me completely.

Yes, there may be things that now seem as if God is at fault.
But, in time, we will know the full truth. Then we will realize
that God has done everything in the best way.

Do children comprehend everything? Neither do we. No matter how
smart we think we are, compared to God, we still have much to
learn.

At this time, we are like children who may think they know
better than their parents, but who will, later on, realize
their parents were right.

When you are tempted to think God is not doing what He should
be doing, look around you at what God has created. (Although we
live in a fallen world where the devil's forces are intent on
stealing, killing, and destroying, the genius of God still
shines brightly in all He created. Remember that death is an
enemy, and storms are something that Jesus rebuked.) Look at
the precision and beauty in all God created. Then realize that
God never changes, and the precise way He perfectly created
things is the same way He is working now to create your future.

God loves you. God knows more than you do. God is perfect. So
trust Him!

SAY THIS: My God is perfect in every way.
