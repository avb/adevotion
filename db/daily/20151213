Believe And Speak

2 CORINTHIANS 4:13 NIV
13 It is written: "I believed; therefore I have spoken." With
that same spirit of faith we also believe and therefore speak,

We are not supposed to just quietly believe. We should express
our belief by speaking it.

In Mark 11:23 when Jesus taught about faith, He stressed the
importance of what you say.

Real faith not only believes, but it speaks what it believes.

The world would have us believe words are not that important.
They think we can just say anything and it doesn't matter, that
"it's just talk!"

But the Bible teaches that our words are extremely important.
Here are just a few verses on the subject.

PROVERBS 18:21 NIV
21 The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who
love it will eat its fruit.

MATTHEW 12:37 NIV
37 For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words
you will be condemned."

ROMANS 10:10 NIV
10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are
justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are
saved.

So we should never be sloppy in our speech. We should only say
what we mean, and mean what we say.

As children of God, and His representatives here on earth, all
our words should also be in agreement with God's will (revealed
in the Bible).

SAY THIS: I will not stop at just believing, but I will also
speak what I believe. I believe God's Word.
