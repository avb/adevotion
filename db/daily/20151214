Count Your Blessings

EPHESIANS 1:3 NLT
3 All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly
realms because we are united with Christ.

An old song says: "Count your blessings, name them one by one,
and it will surprise you what the Lord has done."

It's easy to lose perspective. We all face challenges and
difficulties in life. And if we are not on guard, they can
divert our attention from all the Lord has done for us.

Yes, you may face obstacles, but you need to remember the man
who complained that he had no shoes till he saw a man who had
no feet.

We may not have everything we would like, but we all have
something to be thankful for.

Your children may be a challenge, but at least you have
children.

Your spouse may tempt you to pull your hair out, but there are
millions who would gladly trade places with you.

Your boss may be ruthless, but there are many in the world who
would literally give anything to have any job so they could
feed their family.

Your attitude is determined by your focus. When you focus on
the negative -- you turn negative, making your life, and those
around you, miserable.

It is amazing how different you feel after taking just a few
minutes to truly thank God for what you have.

I can read!
I can see!
I can smell!
I can hear!
I can talk!
I can think!
God loves me!
Jesus died for me!
I have a home in Heaven!

SAY THIS: Thank you Lord for every blessing you have provided
for me.
