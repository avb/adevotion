Ask Jesus In

REVELATION 3:20 NKJ
20 "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My
voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with
him, and he with Me.

Although this verse has been used to encourage sinners to
receive Jesus, it is actually addressed to those who are
already believers.

Jesus is not a gate-crasher. He only enters the areas of your
life into which He is invited.

It is a common mistake to reserve areas of our lives which we
do not invite Jesus to enter. But we need His help in
everything. He is our Savior, the One who can deliver us.

Remember, Jesus did not come to condemn us but to deliver us
from bondage. He proved how much He loves us by dying to save us.

JOHN 3:17 NKJ
17 "For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the
world, but that the world through Him might be saved.

We cannot hide anything from God. He knows our every thought
already. Yet He loves us and desires to help us. But He allows
us to choose to open up to Him, or not.

1 CORINTHIANS 1:9 NKJ
9 God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship
of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

Jesus is not a dictator. He is a ruler, and He deserves to be,
because of His capability. But He allows us to choose. If we
refuse Him and His way, Jesus won't knock the door down and
force His will on us. Instead He invites us by love to
fellowship with Him. This word fellowship means sharing
everything.

Every area of your life that you do not welcome Jesus into,
will be an area less blessed than it could be. Jesus, the
Creator, knows everything. He understands how everything works.
There is no wisdom or knowledge greater than Jesus has.

If you will only invite Jesus in, and allow Him access to every
part of your life, you can be the recipient of all that Jesus
is and all that He has.

SAY THIS: I am not a fool, so I invite You Jesus into every
area of my life.
