You Are Special, But Please Don't Act Like You Are

MATTHEW 23:11 ESV
11 The greatest among you shall be your servant.

Jesus was our perfect example (as well as being our Savior and
Lord). No one could ever be more special than Jesus Christ, but
He did not consider Himself too good to work hard and even to
do menial tasks like washing feet (which would be equivalent to
cleaning toilets today).

You are special because God created you. You are very valuable
-- valuable enough for Jesus Christ to die so you could be in
God's family.

But as a child of God, you are to be "clothed with humility."
Acting like you are better than other people does not please
God. And it won't make you many friends, either!

1 PETER 5:5 ESV
5 Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders.
Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one
another, for "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the
humble."

You are valuable and precious, but so is every other human
being. God loves us all. So don't treat anyone else as if you
are better than they are.

1 CORINTHIANS 4:7 NLT
7 For what gives you the right to make such a judgment? What do
you have that God hasn't given you? And if everything you have
is from God, why boast as though it were not a gift?

When we look at others and are tempted to think we are somehow
superior to them, we need to realize, "There, but for the grace
of God, go I." The only reason you are not in their shoes is
because of God's grace. Without God's help, you could be in
worse shape than they are.

1 CORINTHIANS 15:10 ESV
10 But by the grace of God I am what I am . . .

SAY THIS: I am valuable because God loves me, just as He loves
all people.
