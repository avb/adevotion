Is All The Bible True?

2 TIMOTHY 3:16 NKJ
16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness,

We can have complete confidence that the Bible tells us the
truth. All of it is a message of truth. But some things in the
Bible are truly reported but are not the truth.

For example:

GENESIS 3:4 NKJ
4 Then the serpent said to the woman, "You will not surely die.

It is true that the serpent made that statement. But the
statement he made is not truth.

There are other places in Scripture where what someone says is
truly recorded, but that does not make it all true. For
example, God said all the things spoken by Job's friends
throughout the book of Job were not right. Toward the end of
the book, we read:

JOB 42:7 NKJ
7 And so it was, after the LORD had spoken these words to Job,
that the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My wrath is
aroused against you and your two friends, for you have not
spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has.

So, according to God, some things spoken by these people which
are recorded in the book of Job, are not truth.

JOHN 17:17 NKJ
17 "Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth.

If God said it, it is truth. I believe in the inspiration of
the Bible, that every single word was given by God and can be
depended upon that it happened just as it was recorded.

2 TIMOTHY 2:15 NKJ
15 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker
who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of
truth.

SAY THIS: The Bible always tells me the truth, but not every
statement made in the Bible is a statement of truth.
