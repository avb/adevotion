Keep On Keeping On

GALATIANS 6:9 NLT
9 So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the
right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give
up.

The best advice for being a growing and successful Christian
believer is just to stick with it. Just keep on doing what you
know to do.

More than anything, keep feeding on God's Word. The Word is
what has the power to change things in your life. It is the
power that drives the whole Kingdom of God.

MARK 4:26-28 NLT
26 Jesus also said, "The Kingdom of God is like a farmer who
scatters seed on the ground.
27 Night and day, while he's asleep or awake, the seed sprouts
and grows, but he does not understand how it happens.
28 The earth produces the crops on its own. First a leaf blade
pushes through, then the heads of wheat are formed, and finally
the grain ripens.

Jesus explained in Mark 4:14 that God's Word is the seed. So
God's Word will bring forth God's will in your life if you will
just plant it in your heart and protect it until it produces a
harvest.

Don't worry if it seems like your progress is slow. Just keep
on the right road and you will reach your proper destination.
You can't feel a tree growing by putting your arms around it
either, but day by day it surely grows stronger and stronger.

And don't quit just because you messed up and made some 
mistakes. Receive your forgiveness and go forward. Just because 
the devil tripped you up does not mean you should stay down.

So, keep reading the Bible. Keep on talking to God about
everything. Keep on being thankful. Keep on praising God. Keep
on walking in love. Keep on trusting God even when you don't
understand what is going on.

God understands -- even when you don't. And you can be certain
of His never-failing love for you. So, trust God and keep on
walking in faith and love. Keep on doing what you know is
right.

SAY THIS: I will not quit but will keep on walking with God.
