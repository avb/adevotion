Few Find Fullness Of Life

MATTHEW 7:14 NKJ
14 "Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which
leads to life, and there are few who find it.

Many misinterpret this verse, thinking that Jesus was saying
few people would go to Heaven. Read it again and you will see
that Heaven is never mentioned in this passage.

Jesus was talking about life!

Few people enjoy the fullness of blessing in life that God
intends.

JOHN 10:10 NEB
10 'The thief comes only to steal, to kill, to destroy; I have
come that men may have life, and may have it in all its
fullness.

One of the biggest misunderstandings is thinking that the whole
plan of God is just having our sins forgiven so we can go to
Heaven. That is an important truth, but it is just the first
step. God's plan is much bigger than that. He is raising a
family. He is preparing us to be fit companions for eternity.

God gave us His Word, and sent His Spirit to guide us into all
Truth, so we could know how to live, both now, and for ever.

ACTS 20:32 NKJ
32 "So now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of
His grace, which is able to build you up and give you an
inheritance among all those who are sanctified.

JOHN 8:31-32 NKJ
31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, "If you
abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed.
32 "And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you
free."

SAY THIS: Lord please help me to walk in the way of life as you
intended it to be.
