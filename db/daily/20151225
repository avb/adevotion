Peace On Earth

LUKE 2:13-14 NKJ
13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the
heavenly host praising God and saying:
14 "Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace, goodwill
toward men!"

Peace? On earth? Who are you kidding? Earth is filled with
strife and violence.

What were the angels talking about? What could their message
mean, on that night so long ago, when they appeared to the
shepherds outside of Bethlehem?

Even Jesus made it clear that His first coming to earth was not
for the purpose of bringing peace on earth.

LUKE 12:51 NKJ
51 "Do you suppose that I came to give peace on earth? I tell
you, not at all, but rather division.

Then what were the angels rejoicing about? What was the big
deal that night in Bethlehem?

They were speaking of peace between God and man, not peace
among mankind.

ROMANS 5:1 NKJ
1 Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with
God through our Lord Jesus Christ,

And that is why we can rejoice and celebrate Christmas: Jesus
did everything necessary to erase all alienation between God
and mankind.

Jesus broke down all the barriers between God and man. Now,
through Jesus, we can know God intimately, and enjoy His
fellowship.

Although the work was not finished just by Jesus being born,
yet the angels saw the love that prompted God to take on a
human form, and they looked forward in faith to the completion
of mankind's redemption.

The angels were proclaiming peace and good will from God to
mankind. That is my message, too. God is not against you. God
loves you. God is not your problem. So, turn to God, instead of
turning away from Him.

That is the true message of Christmas. Everyone can be right
with God, because of God's gift -- Jesus Christ.

SAY THIS: Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
