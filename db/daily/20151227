Be Fruitful

GENESIS 1:28 NLT
28 Then God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and multiply.
Fill the earth and govern it. Reign over the fish in the sea,
the birds in the sky, and all the animals that scurry along the
ground."

These are the first words God spoke to a human being.

Being fruitful means being productive. That can include
producing children, but it certainly is not limited to that. It
means to produce something or accomplish something.

Being fruitful gives you a sense of accomplishment, the feeling
that you made a difference.

It does not have to be something others consider great or
something that will make you famous. Keeping a clean home and
providing for your family is being productive. Here are some
more ideas:

Fix something.
Bake something.
Build something.
Plant something.
Start something.
Invent something.
Nurture something.
Help someone.

Anything that helps people can be fulfilling. This is your
purpose as a human being. This is what will fulfill you and
give you satisfaction. (Of course, without God we will never be
satisfied, no matter what we do.)

People who are not productive are not happy because God created
us to be productive. We are designed to accomplish.

Every living human being is capable of this. No matter who you
are, or what your limitations are, there is some way you can
make a difference. For example, everyone can pray for others.

Things such as too much entertainment can keep us from being
fruitful. When that happens we feel unsatisfied and
unfulfilled. But more entertainment is not the answer. Only
walking with God and being fruitful will satisfy us, because
that is how God designed us.

SAY THIS: I can, and will, be fruitful.
