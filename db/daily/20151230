One Thing I Know

JOHN 9:25 NKJ
25 He answered and said, "Whether He is a sinner or not I do
not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I
see."

Others may say all kinds of things about Jesus Christ.

But I know the change Jesus Christ has made in me.

I know the change Jesus Christ has made in the lives of
millions of others now living on earth.

I know the miracles and healings I have seen that were done in
the Name of Jesus Christ.

I know Jesus is alive and that His Word is true, because of
what has happened in my life.

Skeptics may loudly proclaim their theories. But they are too
late to convince me.

Those who think they are scholars may tell me God has changed
and does not do miraculous things in our day, but they are too
late to convince me.

I have tasted and seen for myself that the Lord is good. I
encourage you to do the same.

SAY THIS: I know God is real and Jesus Christ is alive.
