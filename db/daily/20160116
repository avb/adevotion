Put On Humility

1 PETER 5:5 NKJ
5 Likewise you younger people, submit yourselves to your
elders. Yes, all of you be submissive to one another, and be
clothed with humility, for "God resists the proud, But gives
grace to the humble."

Don't run around spiritually naked! Clothe yourself with
humility!

Humility will protect you, just as clothing protects your body.
Without humility you are exposed and vulnerable.

Without being clothed with humility, you risk embarrassment.
Humility will keep you from the mistakes of pride.

What is humility? Humility is an attitude, a way of thinking. 
It is remembering that you only know in part.

True humility is not putting yourself down, but simply seeing
yourself as the Bible says you are. "I am what I am by the
grace of God." Everything you have is a gift from God. So
without Him, you can do NOTHING!

Humility is the opposite of pride. Pride is the wrong 
estimation of yourself, and of others. It is forgetting that 
others are very important to God and greatly loved by Him.

1 CORINTHIANS 4:7 NKJ
7 For who makes you differ from another? And what do you have
that you did not receive? Now if you did indeed receive it, why
do you boast as if you had not received it?

Pride focuses on what I deserve and creates dissatisfaction.
But humility appreciates everything.

The proud person always blames God (or someone else) because
they don't accept that they could be at fault.

Without humility you will be deceived. You will buy the lie
that you have been mistreated by God. So instead of realizing
that you, and other people disobeying God, are the cause of all
your problems, you will blame God.

COLOSSIANS 3:12 NIV
12 Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved,
clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility,
gentleness and patience.

SAY THIS: I will not forget to put on my humility clothes.
