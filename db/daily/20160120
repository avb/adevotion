Fear Is A Form Of Worship

MATTHEW 4:10 NLT
10 "Get out of here, Satan," Jesus told him. "For the
Scriptures say, 'You must worship the Lord your God and serve
only him.'"

The devil craves worship. He wants us to think he is great and
very capable of causing havoc in our lives.

We should not be intimidated by our enemy. Fear is an
acknowledgment of his ability.

God has told us in His Word, over and over, not to fear.

In the New Testament, the main word used for worship can be
summarized as submission, or an attitude of submission because
of profound reverence.

So being controlled by fear is submitting to the devil out of
respect for his power and ability, and it is worship.

We should not do it!

SAY THIS: I will not fear because God loves me and has redeemed
me out of the kingdom of darkness, over which He has given me
authority through the Name of Jesus.
