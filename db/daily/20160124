People Crave Love

1 THESSALONIANS 4:9 NLT
9 But we don't need to write to you about the importance of
loving each other, for God himself has taught you to love one
another.

If you want to understand why people do what they do, realize
that we are created to need love.

It is not just a desire, but a need. If humans are not getting
love, they will do whatever they can to try and get it.

Many foolish and harmful things are done simply because people
are craving love.

We want someone to value us, to even delight in us. We are
driven by our need for love and acceptance. All of us want to
be special to someone.

Insecurity is fear -- fear that you are not good enough, that
you will not be loved if it is known what you are really like.

But God knows everything about you, and He still considers you
so valuable that He was willing to die for you! When you KNOW
God loves you, lesser opinions are not as important.

1 JOHN 4:18 NLT
18 Such love has no fear, because perfect love expels all fear.
If we are afraid, it is for fear of punishment, and this shows
that we have not fully experienced his perfect love.

If people only knew the truth about God -- that He truly loves
them -- they would turn to God wholeheartedly.

We are God's representatives on earth. Unless we love people,
they will not believe God loves them.

1 JOHN 4:7 NLT
7 Dear friends, let us continue to love one another, for love
comes from God. Anyone who loves is a child of God and knows
God.

SAY THIS: Lord help me to love people with Your love.
