You Carry Jesus

JOHN 12:14-15 NKJ
14 Then Jesus, when He had found a young donkey, sat on it; as
it is written:
15 "Fear not, daughter of Zion; Behold, your King is coming,
Sitting on a donkey's colt."

If you have received Jesus, then Jesus lives in you. So
wherever you go, Jesus goes. Just like the donkey in the verse
above, you carry Jesus.

2 CORINTHIANS 6:16 NKJ
16 And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you
are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will
dwell in them And walk among them. I will be their God, And
they shall be My people."

God is not living in a building on earth, but in people who
believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. When people need or want to
find God, they should be able to come to you.

GALATIANS 2:20 NKJ
20 "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who
live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in
the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and
gave Himself for me.

Paul, who wrote this, understood that he was a carrier. You
need to understand that you are also a carrier of Jesus. Jesus
did not die on the cross just to redeem Paul the apostle. You
are saved just like Paul was, with the same salvation and the
same benefits.

COLOSSIANS 1:27 NKJ
27 To them God willed to make known what are the riches of the
glory of this mystery among the Gentiles: which is Christ in
you, the hope of glory.

SAY THIS: I will carry Jesus into my world.
