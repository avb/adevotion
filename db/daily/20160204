Jesus Died For You

ROMANS 8:34 NRS
34 Who is to condemn? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who
was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed
intercedes for us.

The devil would love for us all to doubt that God loves us. But
when you look at the sacrifice of Jesus at Calvary, it is
undeniable.

God loves you!

And He proved it!

ROMANS 5:8 NRS
8 But God proves his love for us in that while we still were
sinners Christ died for us.

ROMANS 8:32 NRS
32 He who did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up for all
of us, will he not with him also give us everything else?

Sometimes it's easy to be tempted to think God does not care.

But if God was just interested in judging and condemning you,
why would He go through the suffering of Calvary?

Being crucified is one of the worst forms of torture and death
ever devised. Jesus willingly suffered all that for you, so you
could go free, and avoid the suffering you deserved.

Someone who was willing to do that for you, would never hurt you.

SAY THIS: Because of His great love for me, Jesus suffered and
died for me. So I can trust Him.
